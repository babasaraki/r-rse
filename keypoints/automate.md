-   A build tool re-runs commands so all files and their dependencies are up-to-date with each other.
-   Make is a widely-used build tool that uses files' timestamps to find out-of-date prerequisites.
-   A Make rule has targets, prerequisites, and actions.
-   A target can correspond to a file or be a phony target (used simply to trigger actions).
-   When a target is out of date with respect to its prerequisites, Make executes the actions associated with its rule.
-   Make executes as many rules as it needs to when updating files, but always respect prerequisite order.
-   Make defines the automatic variables `$@` (target), `$^` (all prerequisites), and `$<` (first prerequisite).
-   Pattern rules can use `%` as a placeholder for parts of filenames.
-   Makefiles can define variables using `NAME=value`.
-   Makefiles can also use functions such as `$(wildcard ...)` and `$(patsubst ...)`.
-   Specially-formatted comments can be used to make Makefiles self-documenting.
