-   The purpose of testing is to convince people (including yourself) that software is correct enough
    and to make tolerances on 'enough' explicit.
-   Add assertions to your code so that it checks itself as it runs.
-   Write unit tests to check small “units” or pieces of your code.
-   Write integration tests to check that multiple units work correctly together.
-   Write regression tests to check if your code is behaving differently than before. 
-   A test framework finds and runs tests written in a prescribed fashion and reports their results.
-   Test coverage refers to how many lines of code are executed by a test suite. 
-   Continuous integration re-builds and/or re-tests software every time something changes.
