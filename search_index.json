It’s still magic even if you know how it’s done. — Terry Pratchett TODO: Fill in this with a brief description on what course does, why its important, etc Computers are now as essential for research as telescopes, test tubes, and libraries, which means that researchers need need to know how to build, use, and share software. However, most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications, not on exploring problems and answering questions. This series of books will show you how to do the latter both on your own and as part of a team. The prequels to this book introduce three core skills: how to write short programs to clean and analyze data in a reproducible way, how to keep track of what you have done, and how to share your software and your results with other people. But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes, some researchers focus on building software to make their colleagues’ lives easier. People who do this are called research software engineers, and the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role—to help you go from writing code for your own use to creating tools to help your entire field advance. TODO: Update section? Needs revision. For researchers and data scientists who can write functions to create programs that are several pages long, and who want to be more productive and have more confidence in their results, this book provides a pragmatic, tools-based introduction to research software engineering. Unlike material courses aimed at computer scientists and professional software developers, this book uses data analysis as a motivating example and assumes that the learner’s ultimate goal is to answer questions rather than ship products. The course material was created using rmarkdown to write the lessons, bookdown to create the book format, GitHub to host the Git repository of the material, and GitHub Actions to create the website.

They can do the last of these in many different ways, of which a graphical user interface (GUI) is the most widely used way. The computer displays icons to show us our files and programs, and we tell it to copy or run those by clicking with a mouse. This style of interaction is easy to learn but hard to automate, and doesn’t create a record of what we did. In contrast, when we use a command-line interface (CLI) we communicate with the computer by typing commands, and the computer responds by displaying text. CLIs existed long before GUIs, and have survived because they are efficient, easy to automate, and automatically create a record of what we did. The heart of every CLI is a read-evaluate-print loop. Its name comes from its basic operating cycle: when we type a command and press Return (also known as Enter) the CLI reads the command, evaluates it (i.e., executes it), prints its output, then loops around and waits for another command. If you have used an interactive console for R, then you have already used a REPL and a simple CLI. This lesson will introduce another kind of CLI that lets us interact with our computer’s operating system. It is called a command shell, or just “shell” for short, and in essence is a program that runs other programs on our behalf (Figure 2.1). Those “other programs” can do things as simple as telling us what time it is or as complex as modeling global climate change; as long as they obey a few simple rules, the shell can run them without having to know what language they are written in or how they do what they do. Figure 2.1: The Shell Programmers have written many different shells over the last forty years. The most popular on Unix systems today, and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows, is called Bash (an acronym of Bourne Again SHell, which is a pun on the name of its predecessor, the Bourne shell). Like other shells, it allows us to combine programs to create pipelines that can handle large volumes of data. Sequences of commands can be saved in a script, just as commands for R can be saved in programs, which makes our workflows more reproducible. Finally, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers—in fact, the shell is practically essential for working with clusters and the cloud. 2.1 How can I explore my files and directories using the shell? When Bash runs it presents us with a prompt to indicate that it is waiting for input. By default, this prompt is a simple dollar sign: $ However, different shells may use a different symbol, and as we’ll see later, we can customize the prompt to give us more information. Don’t Type the Dollar Sign We show the $ prompt so that it’s clear what you are supposed to type, particularly when several commands appear in a row, but you should not type it yourself. Let’s run a command to find out who the shell thinks we are: $ whoami amira Amira is one of the learners described in Section ??; we will use her in the examples that follow. Now that we know who we are, we can explore where we are and what we have. The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories (also called folders) is called the filesystem. Some of the most commonly-used commands in the shell create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. Let’s start exploring them by running the command pwd, which stands for print working directory. The “print” part of its name is straightforward; the “working directory” part refers to the fact that the shell keeps track of our current working directory at all times. Most commands read and write files in the current working directory unless we tell them to do something else, so knowing where we are before running a command is important. $ pwd /Users/amira Here, the computer’s response is /Users/amira, which tells us that we are in a directory called amira that is contained in a top-level directory called User. This directory is Amira’s home directory, and to understand what that phrase means, we must first understand how the filesystem is organized. On Amira’s computer, it looks like Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: Sample Filesystem At the top is the root directory that holds everything else, which we can refer to using a slash character, / on its own. Inside that directory are several other directories, including bin (where some built-in programs are stored), data (for miscellaneous data files), tmp (for temporary files that don’t need to be stored long-term), and Users (where users’ personal directories are located). We know that /Users is stored inside the root directory / because its name begins with /, and that our current working directory /Users/amira is stored inside /Users because /Users is the first part of its name. A string like this is called a path because it tells us how to get from one place in the filesystem (in this case, the root directory) to another (in this case, Amira’s home directory). Slashes The / character means two different things in a path. At the front of a path or on its own, it refers to the root directory. When it appears inside a name, it is a separator. Windows uses backslashes (\\\\) instead of forward slashes as separators. Underneath /Users, we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine. Jun’s files are stored in /Users/jun, Sami’s in /Users/sami, and Amira’s in /Users/amira. This is where the name “home directory” comes from: when we log in as a particular user, the shell starts us off in the directory that holds that user’s files. Home Directory Variations Our home directory will be different on different operating systems. On Linux it may look like /home/amira, and on Windows it may be C:\\Documents and Settings\\amira or C:\\Users\\amira (depending on the version of Windows). Our examples show what we would see on MacOS. Now that we know where we are, let’s see what we have using the command ls, which stands for “listing”: $ ls Applications Documents Library Music Public todo.txt Desktop Downloads Movies Pictures climate-data ls prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory. (Again, our results may be different depending on our operating system and what files or directories we have.) We can make the output of ls more comprehensible by using the -F option (also sometimes called a switch or a flag). Options are exactly like arguments to a function in R; in this case, -F tells ls to add markers to its output to tell us what things are. A trailing / indicates a directory, while a trailing * tell us that something is a runnable program. Depending on our setup, the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory. $ ls -F Applications/ Documents/ Library/ Music/ Public/ todo.txt Desktop/ Downloads/ Movies/ Pictures/ climate-data/ Here, we can see that almost everything in our home directory is a subdirectory; the only thing that isn’t is a file called todo.tt. Spaces Matter 1+2 and 1 + 2 mean the same thing in mathematics, but ls -F and ls-F are very different things in the shell. The shell splits whatever we type into pieces based on spaces, so if we forget to separate ls and -F with at least one space, the shell will try to find a program called ls-F and (quite sensibly) give an error message like ls-F: command not found. Some options tell a command how to behave, but others tell it what to act on. For example, if we want to see what’s in the /Users directory, we can type: $ ls /Users Amira Jun Sami We often call the file and directory names that we give to commands arguments to distinguish them from the built-in options. We can combine options and arguments: $ ls -F /Users Amira/ Jun/ Sami/ but we must put the command’s options (like -F) before the names of any files or directories we want to work on because once the command encounters one of the latter it assumes that we are done giving it built-in options: $ ls /Users -F ls: -F: No such file or directory Amira Jun Sami FIXME: check if -F behaves differently on Linux. 2.2 How can I move around in the shell? Let’s run ls again to look at what’s in our current working directory, which is what the command shows if we don’t ask it to show us anything else: $ ls -F Applications/ Documents/ Library/ Music/ Public/ todo.txt Desktop/ Downloads/ Movies/ Pictures/ climate-data/ If we want to see what’s in climate-data, we can ask ls to list its contents: $ ls -F climate-data NOTES bin/ docs/ thesis.md tofu.config README.md cleaned/ raw/ thesis.pdf Notice that climate-data doesn’t have a leading slash before its name. This absence tells the shell that it is a relative path, i.e., that it should be interpreted starting from our current working directory. In contrast, a path like /Users/amira is an absolute path: it is always interpreted from the root directory down, so it always refers to the same thing. Using a relative path is like telling someone to go two kilometers north and then half a kilometer east; using an absolute path is like giving them the latitude and longitude of their destination. We can use whichever kind of path is easiest to type, but if we are going to do a lot of work with our climate data, the easiest thing would be to change our current working directory so that we don’t have to type climate-data at all. The command to do this is cd, which stands for change directory. This name is a bit misleading: the command doesn’t change the directory, it changes the shell’s idea of what directory we are in. Let’s try it out: $ cd climate-data cd doesn’t print anything. This is normal: many shell commands run silently unless something goes wrong, on the theory that they should only ask for our attention when they need it. To confirm that cd has done what we asked, we can use pwd: $ pwd /Users/amira/climate-data $ ls -F NOTES bin/ docs/ thesis.md tofu.config README.md cleaned/ raw/ thesis.pdf Missing Directories and Unknown Options If we give a command an option that it doesn’t understand, it will usually print an error message and (if we’re lucky) tersely remind us of what we should have done: $ cd -j -bash: cd: -j: invalid option cd: usage: cd [-L|-P] [dir] If, on the other hand, we get the syntax right but make a mistake in the name of a file or directory, it will tell us that: $ cd whoops -bash: cd: whoops: No such file or directory We now know how to go down the directory tree, but how do we go up? This doesn’t work: $ cd amira cd: amira: No such file or directory because amira on its own is a relative path meaning “a file or directory called amira below our current working directory”. To get back home, we can either use an absolute path: $ cd /Users/amira or a special relative path called .. (two periods in a row with no spaces), which always means “the directory that contains the current one”. The directory one level above the one we are in is called the parent directory, and sure enough, .. gets us there: $ cd .. $ pwd /Users/amira ls usually doesn’t show us this special directory—since it’s always there, displaying it every time would be a distraction. We can ask ls to include it using the -a option, which stands for “all”: $ ls -F -a ./ Applications/ Documents/ Library/ Music/ Public/ todo.txt ../ Desktop/ Downloads/ Movies/ Pictures/ climate-data/ (Remember, we are now in /Users/amira.) The output also shows another special directory called . (a single period), which refers to the current working directory. It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we’ll see some uses for it soon. The special names . and .. don’t belong to cd: they are interpreted the same way by every program. For example, if we are in /Users/amira/climate-data, the command ls .. will display a listing of /Users/amira. When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they’re combined, programmers say they are orthogonal. Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn because there are fewer interactions and exceptions to keep track of. Other Hidden Files In addition to the hidden directories .. and ., we may also comes across files with names like .Rhistory. These usually contain settings or other data for particular programs; the prefix . is used to prevent ls from cluttering up the output when we run ls. We can always use the -a option to display them. cd is a simple command, but it allows us to explore several new ideas. First, several .. can be joined by the path separator to move higher than the parent directory in a single step. For example, cd ../.. will move us up two directories (e.g., from /Users/amira/climate-data to /Users), while cd ../Movies will move us up from climate-data and back down into Movies. What happens if we type cd on its own without giving a directory? $ pwd /Users/amira/Movies $ cd $ pwd /Users/amira This works no matter where we are: cd on its own always returns us to our home directory. We can achieve the same thing using the special directory name ~, which is a shortcut for our home directory: $ ls ~ Applications Documents Library Music Public todo.txt Desktop Downloads Movies Pictures climate-data (ls doesn’t show any trailing slashes here because we haven’t used -F.) We can use ~ in paths, so that (for example) ~/Downloads always refers to our download directory. Finally, cd interprets the shortcut - (a single dash) to mean the last directory we were in. Using this is usually faster and more reliable than trying to remember and type the path, but unlike ~, it only works with cd: ls - tries to print a listing of a directory called - rather than showing us the contents of our previous directory. 2.3 How can I create new files and directories? We now know how to explore files and directories, but how do we create them? To find out, let’s go back to our climate-data directory: $ cd ~/climate-data $ ls -F NOTES bin/ docs/ thesis.md tofu.config README.md cleaned/ raw/ thesis.pdf To create a new directory, we use the command mkdir (short for make dirirectory): $ mkdir analysis Since analysis is a relative path (i.e., does not have a leading slash) the new directory is created in the current working directory: $ ls -F NOTES analysis/ cleaned/ raw/ thesis.pdf README.md bin/ docs/ thesis.md tofu.config Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a graphical tool. If we look at the current directory with our computer’s file browser we will see the analysis directory there too. The shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files; the files and directories themselves are the same. Naming Files and Directories Complicated names of files and directories can make our life painful. Following a few simple rules can save a lot of headaches: Don’t use spaces. Spaces can make a name easier to read, but since they are used to separate arguments on the command line, most shell commands interpret a name like My Thesis as two names My and Thesis. Use - or _ instead, e.g, climate-data or climate_data. Don’t begin the name with - (dash) to avoid confusion with command options like -F. Stick with letters, digits, . (period or ‘full stop’), - (dash) and _ (underscore). Many other characters mean special things in the shell. We will learn about some of these during this lesson, but these are always safe. If we need to refer to files or directories that have spaces or other special characters in their names, we can surround the name in quotes (\"\"). For example, ls \"My Thesis\" will work where ls My Thesis does not. Since we just created the thesis directory, it doesn’t contain anything: $ ls -F analysis Let’s change our working directory to analysis using cd, then use a very simple text editor called Nano to create a file called draft.txt (Figure 2.3): $ cd analysis $ nano draft.txt Figure 2.3: The Nano Editor We could just as easily have run nano analysis/draft.txt to edit the file. What’s more important is that when we say “Nano is a text editor” we really do mean “text”: it can only work with plain character data, not spreadsheets, images, Microsoft Word files, or anything else invented after 1970. We use it in this lesson because it runs everywhere and because it is as simple as something can be and still be called an editor. However, that last trait means that we shouldn’t use it for larger tasks, such as writing a program or a paper. Chapter ?? discusses some alternatives. Recycling Pixels Unlike most modern editors, Nano runs inside the shell window instead of opening a new window of its own. This is a holdover from an era when graphical terminals were a rarity and different applications had to share a single character-only screen. Once Nano is open we can type in a few lines of text, then press Ctrl+O (the Control key and the letter ‘O’ at the same time) to save our work. Nano will ask us what file we want to save it to; press Return to accept the suggested default of draft.txt. Once our file is saved, we can use Ctrl+X to exit the editor and return to the shell. Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key The Control key, also called the “Ctrl” key, can be described in a bewildering variety of ways. For example, holding down Control and X at the same time may be written as any of: Control-X Control+X Ctrl-X Ctrl+X C-x ^X When Nano runs it displays some help in the bottom two lines of the screen using the last of these notations: for example, ^G Get Help means “use Control+G to get help” and ^O WriteOut means “use Control+O to write out the current file”. Nano doesn’t leave any output on the screen after it exits, but we can use ls to show that we have indeed created a new file draft.txt: but ls now shows that we have created a file called draft.txt: $ ls draft.txt What’s In A Name? All of Amira’s files are named “something dot something”. This is just a convention: we can call a file mythesis or almost anything else. However, most people use two-part names to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the filename extension and indicates what type of data the file holds: .txt for plain text, .pdf for a PDF document, .png for a PNG image, and so on. This is just a convention: saving a PNG image of a whale as whale.mp3 doesn’t somehow magically turn it into a recording of whalesong, though it might cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player when someone double-clicks it. 2.4 How can move files and directories around? Let’s go back to our climate-data directory: cd ~/climate-data The analysis directory contains a file called draft.txt. That isn’t a particularly informative name, so let’s change it using mv (short for move): $ mv analysis/draft.txt analysis/prior-work.txt The first argument tells mv what we are “moving”, while the second is where it’s to go: here, moving analysis/draft.txt to analysis/prior-work.txt has the same effect as renaming the file: $ ls analysis prior-work.txt We must be careful when specifying the destination because mv will silently overwrite any existing file with the same name. An option -i (for “interactive”) makes mv ask us for confirmation before overwriting. mv also works on directories, so mv analysis first-paper would rename the directory without changing its contents. Now suppose we want to move prior-work.txt into the current working directory. If we don’t want to change the file’s name, just its location, we can provide mv with a directory as a destination and it will move the file there. In this case, the directory we want is the special name . that we mentioned earlier: $ mv analysis/prior-work.txt . ls now shows us that analysis is empty: $ ls analysis and that our current directory now contains our file: $ ls NOTES analysis/ cleaned/ prior-work.txt thesis.md tofu.config README.md bin/ docs/ raw/ thesis.pdf If we only want to check that the file exists, we can give its name to ls just like we can give the command the name of a directory: $ ls prior-work.txt prior-work.txt 2.5 How can I copy files and directories? The cp command (for copy, and no, we don’t know why the creators of Unix seemed to be allergic to vowels) works like mv except it copies a file instead of moving it. We can check that it did the right thing using ls with two arguments: $ cp prior-work.txt analysis/section-1.txt $ ls prior-work.txt analysis/section-1.txt analysis/section-1.txt prior-work.txt Notice that ls shows the output in alphabetical order. If we leave off the second filename and ask it to show us a file and a directory (or multiple directories) it lists them one by one: $ ls prior-work.txt analysis prior-work.txt analysis: section-1.txt Copying a directory and its content is a little more complicated. If we use cp on its own, we get an error message: $ cp analysis backup cp: analysis is a directory (not copied). If we really want to copy everything, we must give cp the -r option (meaning recursive: $ cp -r analysis backup Once again we can check the result with ls: $ ls analysis backup analysis/: section-1.txt backup/: section-1.txt 2.6 How can I delete files and directories? Let’s tidy up by removing the prior-work.txt file we created in our climate-data directory. The command to do this is rm (for remove): $ rm prior-work.txt We can confirm the file has gone using ls: $ ls prior-work.txt ls: prior-work.txt: No such file or directory Deleting is forever: the Unix shell doesn’t have a trash bin that we can recover deleted files from (though most graphical interfaces for Unix do), so when we delete a file, it really is gone—or at least gone-ish. Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist, but there is no guarantee they will work, since the computer may recycle the file’s disk space at any time. In a half-hearted attempt to stop us from erasing things accidentally, rm refuses to delete directories: $ rm analysis rm: analysis: is a directory rm can remove a directory and everything it contains if we use the recursive option -r: $ rm -r analysis rm -r should be used with great caution: in most cases, it’s safest to add the -i option (for interactive) to get rm to ask us to confirm each deletion. As a halfway measure, we can use -v (for verbose) to get rm to print a message for each file it deletes. This options works the same way with mv and cp. 2.7 How can I run commands on lots of files at once? The cleaned directory in our climate data project contains precipitation and temperature records from four weather stations in Australia: $ ls cleaned andamooka_prec.csv badingarra_prec.csv bellambi_prec.csv tuggeranong_prec.csv andamooka_temp.csv badingarra_temp.csv bellambi_temp.csv tuggeranong_temp.csv The wc command (short for word count) can tell us how many lines, words, and letters there are in one of these files: $ wc cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv 20003 20004 401858 cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv What’s in a Word? The number of lines and number of words in this file are almost the same because wc only considers spaces to be word breaks, not commas, and the only space in this file occurs in the name of one of the columns. We could run wc seven more times to count find out how many lines there are in the other files, but that would be a lot of typing and we would probably make at least one mistake. We can’t just give wc the name of the directory as we do with ls: $ wc cleaned wc: cleaned: read: Is a directory Instead, we can use wildcards to select a set of filenames at once. The most commonly-used wildcard is *; it matches zero or more characters, so cleaned/*.csv matches all of the files in the cleaned directory: $ ls cleaned/*.csv cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv cleaned/badingarra_prec.csv cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv cleaned/tuggeranong_prec.csv cleaned/andamooka_temp.csv cleaned/badingarra_temp.csv cleaned/bellambi_temp.csv cleaned/tuggeranong_temp.csv while cleaned/b*.csv only matches the four whose names begin with a ‘b’: $ ls cleaned/b*.csv cleaned/badingarra_prec.csv cleaned/badingarra_temp.csv cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv cleaned/bellambi_temp.csv Wildcards are expanded to match filenames before commands are run, so they work exactly the same way for every command. This means that we can use them with wc to (for example) count the number of records in the precipitation files: $ wc cleaned/*_prec.csv 20003 20004 401858 cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv 21099 21100 406584 cleaned/badingarra_prec.csv 8315 8316 169740 cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv 8681 8682 175998 cleaned/tuggeranong_prec.csv 58098 58102 1154180 total or the number of records in the files from Tuggeranong: $ wc cleaned/tug*.csv 8681 8682 175998 cleaned/tuggeranong_prec.csv 8680 8681 196212 cleaned/tuggeranong_temp.csv 17361 17363 372210 total The exercises will introduce and explore other wildcards (such as ?, which matches exactly one character). For now, the only other thing we need to know is that it’s possible for a wildcard expression to not match anything. In this case, the command will usually print an error message: $ wc cleaned/*.txt wc: cleaned/*.txt: open: No such file or directory 2.8 How can I find out what commands there are and how to use them? By default, wc displays lines, words, and characters, but we can ask it to display only a count of lines: $ wc -l cleaned/*_prec.csv 20003 cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv 21099 cleaned/badingarra_prec.csv 8315 cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv 8681 cleaned/tuggeranong_prec.csv 58098 total wc has other options as well. We can use the man command (short for manual) to find out what they are: $ man wc FIXME: typeset the text below as a figure with callouts pointing at its parts. WC(1) BSD General Commands Manual WC(1) NAME wc -- word, line, character, and byte count SYNOPSIS wc [-clmw] [file ...] DESCRIPTION The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output. A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a &lt;newline&gt; character. Characters beyond the final &lt;newline&gt; charac- ter will not be included in the line count. A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space characters. White space characters are the set of characters for which the iswspace(3) function returns true. If more than one input file is specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on a separate line after the output for the last file. The following options are available: -c The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output. This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option. -l The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard output. -m The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output. If the current locale does not support multi- byte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option. This will cancel out any prior usage of the -c option. -w The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output. When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by that option. The order of output always takes the form of line, word, byte, and file name. The default action is equivalent to specifying the -c, -l and -w options. If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is displayed. The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF, or [^D] in most environments. ENVIRONMENT The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution of wc as described in environ(7). EXIT STATUS The wc utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs. EXAMPLES Count the number of characters, words and lines in each of the files report1 and report2 as well as the totals for both: wc -mlw report1 report2 COMPATIBILITY Historically, the wc utility was documented to define a word as a &quot;maxi- mal string of characters delimited by &lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; charac- ters&quot;. The implementation, however, did not handle non-printing charac- ters correctly so that &quot; ^D^E &quot; counted as 6 spaces, while &quot;foo^D^Ebar&quot; counted as 8 characters. 4BSD systems after 4.3BSD modi- fied the implementation to be consistent with the documentation. This implementation defines a &quot;word&quot; in terms of the iswspace(3) function, as required by IEEE Std 1003.2 (&quot;POSIX.2&quot;). SEE ALSO iswspace(3) STANDARDS The wc utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (&quot;POSIX.1&quot;). HISTORY A wc command appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.

We can use ↑ and ↓ to move line-by-line or Ctrl+Spacebar and Spacebar to skip up and down one page at a time. (B and F also work.) To search for a character or word, use / followed by the character or word to search for. If the search produces multiple hits, we can move between them using N (for “next”). To quit, press Q. This is a lot of information, most of which isn’t really useful. Some commands have a --help option to provide a succinct summary of possibilites, but the best place to go for help these days is probably the TLDR website. The acronym stands for “too long, didn’t read”, and its help for wc displays this: wc Count words, bytes, or lines. Count lines in file: wc -l {{file}} Count words in file: wc -w {{file}} Count characters (bytes) in file: wc -c {{file}} Count characters in file (taking multi-byte character sets into account): wc -m {{file}} edit this page on github As the last line suggests, all of its examples are in a public GitHub repository so that users like you can add the ones you wish it had. For more information, we can search on Stack Overflow or browse the GNU manuals (particularly those for the core GNU utilities, which include many of the commands introduced in this lesson). In all cases, though, we need to have some idea of what we’re looking for in the first place: someone who wants to know how many lines there are in a data file is unlikely to think to look for wc. 2.9 How can I combine commands? Now that we know a few basic commands, we can introduce one of the shell’s most powerful features: the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways. Let’s go into the climate-data/cleaned directory and count the number of lines in each file once again: $ cd ~/climate-data/cleaned $ wc -l *.csv 20003 andamooka_prec.csv 18541 andamooka_temp.csv 21099 badingarra_prec.csv 20002 badingarra_temp.csv 8315 bellambi_prec.csv 8314 bellambi_temp.csv 8681 tuggeranong_prec.csv 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv 113635 total Which of these files is shortest? It’s easy to see when there are only eight files, but what if there were eight thousand? Our first step toward a solution is to run the command: $ wc -l *.csv &gt; lengths.txt The greater than symbol &gt; tells the shell to redirect the command’s output to a file instead of printing it. Nothing appears on the screen: everything that would have appeared has gone into the file lengths.txt instead. The shell creates this file if it doesn’t exist, or overwrites it if it already exists. ls lengths.txt confirms that the file exists: $ ls lengths.txt lengths.txt We can print the contents of lengths.txt using cat (short for concatenate). Its name comes from the fact that it will print as many files as we give it, one after the other. If we give it just one name, all we get is that file: $ cat lengths.txt 20003 andamooka_prec.csv 18541 andamooka_temp.csv 21099 badingarra_prec.csv 20002 badingarra_temp.csv 8315 bellambi_prec.csv 8314 bellambi_temp.csv 8681 tuggeranong_prec.csv 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv 113635 total We can now use sort to sort the lines in this file: $ sort lengths.txt 8314 bellambi_temp.csv 8315 bellambi_prec.csv 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv 8681 tuggeranong_prec.csv 18541 andamooka_temp.csv 20002 badingarra_temp.csv 20003 andamooka_prec.csv 21099 badingarra_prec.csv 113635 total Just to be safe, we should use sort’s -n option to specify that we want to sort numerically; without this, sort would sort things alphabetically and 10 would come before 2. sort does not change lengths.txt, but it sends its output to the screen just as wc did. We can therefore put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called sorted-lengths.txt using &gt;: $ sort lengths.txt &gt; sorted-lengths.txt Redirecting to the Same File It’s tempting to send the output of sort back to the file it reads: $ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; lengths.txt However, all this does is wipe out the contents of lengths.txt. The reason is that when the shell sees the redirection, it opens the file on the right of the &gt; for writing, which erases anything that file contained. It then runs sort, which finds itself reading from a newly-empty file. Creating intermediate files with names like lengths.txt and sorted-lengths.txt works, but keeping track of those files and cleaning them up when they’re no longer needed is a burden. We can produce the same result more safely and with less typing using a pipe: $ wc -l *.csv | sort -n 8314 bellambi_temp.csv 8315 bellambi_prec.csv 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv 8681 tuggeranong_prec.csv 18541 andamooka_temp.csv 20002 badingarra_temp.csv 20003 andamooka_prec.csv 21099 badingarra_prec.csv 113635 total The vertical bar | between the wc and sort commands tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left as the input to the command on the right. Putting it another way, the downstream command doesn’t read from a file; instead, it reads the output of the upstream command. We can use | to build pipes of any length. For example, we can use the command head to get just the first three lines of sorted data: $ wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 3 8314 bellambi_temp.csv 8315 bellambi_prec.csv 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv If we want the last line of this, we can add a call to the tail command: $ wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 3 | tail -n 1 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv and finally save our result: $ wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 3 | tail -n 1 &gt; results.txt In practice, most Unix users would create this pipeline exactly as we have, by starting with a single command and adding others one by one, checking the output after each change. The shell makes this easy by letting us move up and down in our command history using the ↑ and ↓ keys and editing old commands to create new ones. 2.10 How do pipes work (and why do I need to know)? In order to use pipes and redirection effectively, we need to know just a little about how they work. When a computer runs a program—any program—it creates a process in memory to hold the program’s instructions and data. Every process in Unix has an input channel called standard input and an output channel called standard output. (By this point you may be surprised that their names are so memorable, but don’t worry: most Unix programmers call them stdin and stdout). The shell is a program like any other, and like any other, it runs inside a process. Under normal circumstances its standard input is connected to our keyboard and its standard output to our screen, so it reads what we type and displays its output for us to see (Figure 2.4a). When we tell the shell to run a program it creates a new process and temporarily reconnects the keyboard and stream to that process’s standard input and output (Figure 2.4b). Figure 2.4: Standard I/O Redirection with &gt; tells the shell to connect the program’s standard output to a file instead of to the screen (Figure 2.4c). If we provide one or more files for the command to read, as with sort lengths.txt, the program reads data from those files. If we don’t provide any filenames, though, the Unix convention is for the program to read from standard input. We can test this by running sort on its own, typing in a few lines of text, and then pressing Ctrl+D to signal the end of input. sort will then sort and print whatever we typed: $ sort one two three four ^D four one three two When we create a pipe like wc *.csv | sort, the shell creates one process for each command so that wc and sort will run simultaneously, and then connects the standard output of wc directly to the standard input of sort (Figure 2.5). wc doesn’t know whether its output is going to the screen, another program, or to a file via &gt;. Equally, sort doesn’t know if its input is coming from the keyboard or another process; it just knows that it has to read, sort, and print. Figure 2.5: Misconnection Why Isn’t It Doing Anything? What happens if a command is supposed to process a file but we don’t give it a filename? For example, what if we type: $ wc -l but don’t type *.csv (or anything else) after the command? Since it doesn’t have any filenames, wc assumes it is supposed to read from the keyboard, so it waits for us to type in some data. It doesn’t tell us this: it just sits and waits. This mistake can be hard to spot, particularly if we put the filename at the end of the pipeline: $ wc -l | sort bellambi_temp.csv In this case, sort ignores standard input and reads the data in the file, but wc still just sits there waiting for input. If we make this mistake, we can end the program by typing Ctrl+C. We can also use this to interrupt programs that are taking a long time to run or are trying to connect to a website that isn’t responding. Just as we can redirect standard output with &gt;, we can connect standard input to a file using &lt;. In the case of a single file, this has the same effect as providing the file’s name to the command: $ wc &lt; bellambi_temp.csv 8314 8316 184203 If we try to use redirection with a wildcard, though, the shell doesn’t concatenate all of the matching files: $ wc &lt; *.csv -bash: *.csv: ambiguous redirect It also doesn’t print the error message to standard output, which we can prove by redirecting: $ wc &lt; *.csv &gt; all.txt -bash: *.csv: ambiguous redirect $ cat all.txt cat: all.txt: No such file or directory Every process has a second output channel called standard error (or stderr). Programs use it for error messages so that their attempts to tell us something has gone wrong don’t vanish silently into an output file. There are ways to redirect standard error, but doing so is almost always a bad idea. 2.11 How can I do the same operations on many files? A loop is a way to repeat a set of commands for each item in a list. We can use them to build complex workflows out of simple pieces, and, like wildcards, they reduce the typing we have to do and the number of mistakes we might make. Let’s suppose that we want to take a slice out of each temperature data file in the cleaned directory— more specifically, that we want to get the first three rows of each file without the header row. If we only cared about one file, we could use a simple pipeline to take the first four lines and then take the last three of those: $ head -n 4 andamooka_temp.csv | tail -n 3 16065,1969,1,1,, 16065,1969,1,2,, 16065,1969,1,3,, If we try to use a wildcard to select files, we only get three lines of output, not the 12 we expect: $ head -n 4 *.csv | tail -n 3 70339,1996,1,1,, 70339,1996,1,2,, 70339,1996,1,3,, The problem is that head is producing a single stream of output containing four lines for each file (along with a header telling us the file’s name): $ head -n 4 *.csv ==&gt; andamooka_temp.csv &lt;== Station,Year,Month,Day,Max Temp (C),Quality 16065,1969,1,1,, 16065,1969,1,2,, 16065,1969,1,3,, ==&gt; badingarra_temp.csv &lt;== Station,Year,Month,Day,Max Temp (C),Quality 9037,1965,1,1,40.6,Y 9037,1965,1,2,40,Y 9037,1965,1,3,41.1,Y ==&gt; bellambi_temp.csv &lt;== Station,Year,Month,Day,Max Temp (C),Quality 68228,1997,1,1,, 68228,1997,1,2,, 68228,1997,1,3,, ==&gt; tuggeranong_temp.csv &lt;== Station,Year,Month,Day,MaxTemp (C),Quality 70339,1996,1,1,, 70339,1996,1,2,, 70339,1996,1,3,, Let’s try this instead: $ for filename in andamooka_temp.csv badingarra_temp.csv &gt; do &gt; head -n 4 $filename &gt; done Station,Year,Month,Day,Max Temp (C),Quality 16065,1969,1,1,, 16065,1969,1,2,, 16065,1969,1,3,, Station,Year,Month,Day,Max Temp (C),Quality 9037,1965,1,1,40.6,Y 9037,1965,1,2,40,Y 9037,1965,1,3,41.1,Y There is a lot going on here, so we will break it down into pieces: The keywords for…in…do…done create the loop, and must always appear in that order. filename is a variable. At any moment it contains a value, which can change over time. The loop runs once for each item in the list. Each time it runs, it assigns the next item to the variable, so in this case, filename will be andamooka_temp.csv the first time around and badingarra_temp.csv the second time. The commands that the loop executes (which are called the body of the loop) appear between do and done. Those commands use the current value of the variable filename, but to get it, we must put a dollar sign $ in front of the variable’s name. If we forget and use filename instead of $filename, the shell will think that we are actually referring to something called filename. The shell prompt changes from $ to &gt; and back again as we type in our loop. The second prompt is called a continuation prompt; it is different to remind us that we haven’t finished typing a complete command yet. So what does the loop actually do? As the output shows, it runs our little pipeline separately for each file. Let’s use a wildcard expression to select all four temperature files and add another stage to the pipeline: $ for filename in *_temp.csv &gt; do &gt; head -n 4 $filename | tail -n 3 &gt; done 16065,1969,1,1,, 16065,1969,1,2,, 16065,1969,1,3,, 9037,1965,1,1,40.6,Y 9037,1965,1,2,40,Y 9037,1965,1,3,41.1,Y 68228,1997,1,1,, 68228,1997,1,2,, 68228,1997,1,3,, 70339,1996,1,1,, 70339,1996,1,2,, 70339,1996,1,3,, The weather station IDs in the first column show that we are in fact getting exactly three rows from each of four files. Same Symbols, Different Meanings The computer displays &gt; as a shell continuation prompt when we are typing, but when we type &gt; ourselves, it means “redirect output”. Similarly, $ is a regular prompt when the computer prints it but means “get the value of a variable” when we type. This overloading is sometimes confusing, but there are only so many symbols on a standard keyboard. 2.12 What do variable names mean? The short answer to this section’s title is “nothing”. We have called the variable in this loop filename to make its purpose clear to human readers, but the shell doesn’t care what the variable is called. We could equally well write our loop as: $ for f in *_temp.csv &gt; do &gt; head -n 4 $f | tail -n 3 &gt; done or: $ for username in *_temp.csv &gt; do &gt; head -n 4 $username | tail -n 3 &gt; done Don’t do this. Programs are only useful if people can understand them, so meaningless names like f and misleading names like username increase the odds of misunderstanding. 2.13 How can I re-do things I have done recently? Loops are useful if we know in advance what we want to repeat, but if we have already run commands, we can still repeat. One way is to use ↑ and ↓ to go up and down in our command history as described earlier. Another is to use the history command to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed: $ history ... 571 wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head n 3 572 wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 3 573 wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 3 | tail -n 1 ... and then use an exclamation mark ! followed by a number to repeat one of those commands: $ !572 wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 3 8314 bellambi_temp.csv 8315 bellambi_prec.csv 8680 tuggeranong_temp.csv The shell prints the command it is going to run to standard error rather than to standard output, so that (for example) !572 &gt; results.txt puts the command’s output into a file without also writing the command. Having an accurate record of what we have done and a simple way to repeat it are yet another reason why people use the Unix shell. In fact, being able to repeat history is such a powerful idea that the shell gives us several ways to do it. !head re-runs the most recent command starting with head, while !wc re-runs the most recent starting with wc. If we type Ctrl+R the shell does an interactive reverse search for whatever we type next. If we don’t like the first thing it finds, we can type Ctrl+R again to go further back. If we use history, ↑, or Ctrl+R, we will quickly notice that loops don’t have to be broken across lines. Instead, their parts can be separated with semi-colons: $ for filename in *_temp.csv; do head -n 4 $filename | tail -n 3; done This is fairly readable, although even experienced users have a tendency to put the semi-colon after do instead of before it. If our loop contains multiple commands, though, the multi-line format is much easier to read—compare this: $ for filename in *_temp.csv &gt; do &gt; echo $filename &gt; head -n 4 $filename | tail -n 3 &gt; done with this: $ for filename in *_temp.csv; do echo $filename; head -n 4 $filename | tail -n 3; done 2.14 How can I create new filenames automatically? Suppose we want to create a backup copy of each precipitation data file. If we don’t want to change the files’ names, we can do this with cp: $ cd ~/climate-data $ mkdir backup $ cp cleaned/*_prec.csv backup But what if we want the backup files to have the extension .bak instead of .csv? cp can do this for a single file: $ cp cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv backup/andamooka_prec.bak but can’t do all the files at once: $ cp cleaned/*_prec.csv backup/*_prec.bak usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvXc] source_file target_file cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvXc] source_file ... target_directory backup/*_prec.bak doesn’t match anything—those files don’t yet exist—so what we are actually asking cp to do is: $ cp cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv cleaned/badingarra_prec.csv cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv cleaned/tuggeranong_prec.csv This doesn’t work because cp only understands how to do two things: copy a single file to create another file, or copy a bunch of files into a directory. If we give it more than two names as arguments, it expects the last one to be a directory; since it isn’t, it reports an error. Instead, let’s copy all the files and then rename them: $ cp cleaned/*_prec.csv backup $ for filename in backup/*.csv &gt; do &gt; mv $filename $filename.bak &gt; done $ ls backup andamooka_prec.csv.bak badingarra_prec.csv.bak bellambi_prec.csv.bak tuggeranong_prec.csv.bak 2.15 Exercises 2.15.1 Exploring more ls flags You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command ls do when used with the -l option? What about if you use both the -l and the -h option? Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful nevertheless. 2.15.2 Listing recursively and by time The command ls -R lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists their subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so on at each level. The command ls -t lists things by time of last change, with most recently changed files or directories first. In what order does ls -R -t display things? Hint: ls -l uses a long listing format to view timestamps. 2.15.3 Absolute and relative paths Starting from /Users/amanda/data, which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is /Users/amanda? cd . cd / cd /home/amanda cd ../.. cd ~ cd home cd ~/data/.. cd cd .. 2.15.4 Relative path resolution Using the filesystem shown in Figure 2.6, if pwd displays /Users/thing, what will ls -F ../backup display? ../backup: No such file or directory 2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27 2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/ original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/ Figure 2.6: Exercise Filesystem 2.15.5 ls reading comprehension Using the filesystem shown in Figure 2.7, if pwd displays /Users/backup, and -r tells ls to display things in reverse order, what command(s) will result in the following output: pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/ Figure 2.7: Filesystem for Exercise ls pwd ls -r -F ls -r -F /Users/backup 2.15.6 Creating files a different way We have seen how to create text files using the nano editor. Now, try the following command: $ touch my_file.txt What did the touch command do? When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer, does the file show up? Use ls -l to inspect the files. How large is my_file.txt? When might you want to create a file this way? 2.15.7 Moving to the current folder After running the following commands, Jamie realizes that she put the files sucrose.dat and maltose.dat into the wrong folder: $ ls -F analyzed/ raw/ $ ls -F analyzed fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat $ cd raw/ Fill in the blanks to move these files to the current folder (i.e., the one she is currently in): $ mv ___/sucrose.dat ___/maltose.dat ___ 2.15.8 Renaming files Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: statstics.txt After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so? cp statstics.txt statistics.txt mv statstics.txt statistics.txt mv statstics.txt . cp statstics.txt . 2.15.9 Moving and copying What is the output of the closing ls command in the sequence shown below? $ pwd /Users/jamie/data $ ls proteins.dat $ mkdir recombine $ mv proteins.dat recombine/ $ cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat $ ls proteins-saved.dat recombine recombine proteins.dat recombine proteins-saved.dat 2.15.10 Using rm safely What happens when we execute rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt? Why would we want this protection when using rm? 2.15.11 Copy with multiple filenames For this exercise, you can test the commands in the data-shell/data directory. In the example below, what does cp do when given several filenames and a directory name? $ mkdir backup $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/ In the example below, what does cp do when given three or more file names? $ ls -F amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/ elements/ morse.txt pdb/ planets.txt salmon.txt sunspot.txt $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt 2.15.12 List filenames matching a pattern When run in the molecules directory, which ls command(s) will produce this output? ethane.pdb methane.pdb ls *t*ane.pdb ls *t?ne.* ls *t??ne.pdb ls ethane.* 2.15.13 More on wildcards Sam has a directory containing calibration data, datasets, and descriptions of the datasets: . ├── 2015-10-23-calibration.txt ├── 2015-10-23-dataset1.txt ├── 2015-10-23-dataset2.txt ├── 2015-10-23-dataset_overview.txt ├── 2015-10-26-calibration.txt ├── 2015-10-26-dataset1.txt ├── 2015-10-26-dataset2.txt ├── 2015-10-26-dataset_overview.txt ├── 2015-11-23-calibration.txt ├── 2015-11-23-dataset1.txt ├── 2015-11-23-dataset2.txt ├── 2015-11-23-dataset_overview.txt ├── backup │ ├── calibration │ └── datasets └── send_to_bob ├── all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd └── all_november_files Before heading off to another field trip, she wants to back up her data and send some datasets to her colleague Bob.

What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so that the commands below will produce the output shown? $ ls -F analyzed/ raw/ $ ls analyzed fructose.dat sucrose.dat 2.15.15 Reproduce a directory structure You’re starting a new experiment, and would like to duplicate the directory structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data. Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called ‘2016-05-18’, which contains a data folder that in turn contains folders named raw and processed that contain data files. The goal is to copy the folder structure of the 2016-05-18-data folder into a folder called 2016-05-20 so that your final directory structure looks like this: 2016-05-20/ └── data ├── processed └── raw Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do? $ mkdir 2016-05-20 $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw $ mkdir 2016-05-20 $ cd 2016-05-20 $ mkdir data $ cd data $ mkdir raw processed $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed $ mkdir 2016-05-20 $ cd 2016-05-20 $ mkdir data $ mkdir raw processed 2.15.16 What does sort -n do? If we run sort on a file containing the following lines: 10 2 19 22 6 the output is: 10 19 2 22 6 If we run sort -n on the same input, we get this instead: 2 6 10 19 22 Explain why -n has this effect. 2.15.17 What does &gt;&gt; mean? We have seen the use of &gt;, but there is a similar operator &gt;&gt; which works slightly differently. We’ll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings. We can use the echo command to print strings e.g. $ echo The echo command prints text The echo command prints text Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators: $ echo hello &gt; testfile01.txt and: $ echo hello &gt;&gt; testfile02.txt Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files. 2.15.18 Appending data We have already met the head command, which prints lines from the start of a file. tail is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead. Consider the file data-shell/data/animals.txt. After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file animals-subset.txt: $ head -n 3 animals.txt &gt; animals-subset.txt $ tail -n 2 animals.txt &gt;&gt; animals-subset.txt The first three lines of animals.txt The last two lines of animals.txt The first three lines and the last two lines of animals.txt The second and third lines of animals.txt 2.15.19 Piping commands In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of lines. Which command listed below would work? wc -l * &gt; sort -n &gt; head -n 3 wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3 wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3 2.15.20 Why does uniq only remove adjacent duplicates? The command uniq removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input. For example, the file data-shell/data/salmon.txt contains: coho coho steelhead coho steelhead steelhead Running the command uniq salmon.txt from the data-shell/data directory produces: coho steelhead coho steelhead Why do you think uniq only removes adjacent duplicated lines? (Hint: think about very large data sets.) What other command could you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines? 2.15.21 Pipe reading comprehension A file called animals.txt (in the data-shell/data folder) contains the following data: 2012-11-05,deer 2012-11-05,rabbit 2012-11-05,raccoon 2012-11-06,rabbit 2012-11-06,deer 2012-11-06,fox 2012-11-07,rabbit 2012-11-07,bear What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below? $ cat animals.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r &gt; final.txt Hint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding 2.15.22 Pipe construction For the file animals.txt from the previous exercise, consider the following command: $ cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt The cut command is used to remove or “cut out” certain sections of each line in the file. The -d option is used to define the delimiter. A delimiter is a character that is used to separate each line of text into columns. The default delimiter is Tab, meaning that the cut command will automatically assume that values in different columns will be separated by a tab. The -f option is used to specify the field (column) to cut out. The command above uses the -d option to split each line by comma, and the -f option to print the second field in each line, to give the following output: deer rabbit raccoon rabbit deer fox rabbit bear What other command(s) could be added to this in a pipeline to find out what animals the file contains (without any duplicates in their names)? 2.15.23 Which pipe? The file animals.txt contains 8 lines of data formatted as follows: 2012-11-05,deer 2012-11-05,rabbit 2012-11-05,raccoon 2012-11-06,rabbit ... The uniq command has a -c option which gives a count of the number of times a line occurs in its input. Assuming your current directory is data-shell/data/, what command would you use to produce a table that shows the total count of each type of animal in the file? sort animals.txt | uniq -c sort -t, -k2,2 animals.txt | uniq -c cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | uniq -c cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l 2.15.24 Wildcard expressions Wildcard expressions can be very complex, but you can sometimes write them in ways that only use simple syntax, at the expense of being a bit more verbose. Consider the directory data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 : the wildcard expression *[AB].txt matches all files ending in A.txt or B.txt. Imagine you forgot about this. Can you match the same set of files with basic wildcard expressions that do not use the [] syntax? Hint: You may need more than one expression. The expression that you found and the expression from the lesson match the same set of files in this example. What is the small difference between the outputs? Under what circumstances would your new expression produce an error message where the original one would not? 2.15.25 Removing unneeded files Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep your raw files and processing script to save storage. The raw files end in .dat and the processed files end in .txt. Which of the following would remove all the processed data files, and only the processed data files? rm ?.txt rm *.txt rm * .txt rm *.* 2.15.26 Doing a dry run A loop is a way to do many things at once—or to make many mistakes at once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop would do is to echo the commands it would run instead of actually running them. Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute without actually running those commands: $ for file in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; analyze $file &gt; analyzed-$file &gt; done What is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we want to run? # Version 1 $ for file in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; echo analyze $file &gt; analyzed-$file &gt; done # Version 2 $ for file in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; echo &quot;analyze $file &gt; analyzed-$file&quot; &gt; done 2.15.27 Nested loops Suppose we want to set up up a directory structure to organize some experiments measuring reaction rate constants with different compounds and different temperatures. What would be the result of the following code: $ for species in cubane ethane methane &gt; do &gt; for temperature in 25 30 37 40 &gt; do &gt; mkdir $species-$temperature &gt; done &gt; done 2.15.28 Variables in loops This exercise refers to the data-shell/molecules directory. ls gives the following output: cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb What is the output of the following code? $ for datafile in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; ls *.pdb &gt; done Now, what is the output of the following code? $ for datafile in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; ls $datafile &gt; done Why do these two loops give different outputs? 2.15.29 Limiting sets of files What would be the output of running the following loop in the data-shell/molecules directory? $ for filename in c* &gt; do &gt; ls $filename &gt; done No files are listed. All files are listed. Only cubane.pdb, octane.pdb and pentane.pdb are listed. Only cubane.pdb is listed. How would the output differ from using this command instead? $ for filename in *c* &gt; do &gt; ls $filename &gt; done The same files would be listed. All the files are listed this time. No files are listed this time. The files cubane.pdb and octane.pdb will be listed. Only the file octane.pdb will be listed. 2.15.30 Saving to a file in a loop In the data-shell/molecules directory, what is the effect of this loop? for alkanes in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; echo $alkanes &gt; cat $alkanes &gt; alkanes.pdb &gt; done Prints cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, pentane.pdb and propane.pdb, and the text from propane.pdb will be saved to a file called alkanes.pdb. Prints cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, and methane.pdb, and the text from all three files would be concatenated and saved to a file called alkanes.pdb. Prints cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, and pentane.pdb, and the text from propane.pdb will be saved to a file called alkanes.pdb. None of the above. Also in the data-shell/molecules directory, what would be the output of the following loop? for datafile in *.pdb &gt; do &gt; cat $datafile &gt;&gt; all.pdb &gt; done All of the text from cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, and pentane.pdb would be concatenated and saved to a file called all.pdb. The text from ethane.pdb will be saved to a file called all.pdb. All of the text from cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, pentane.pdb and propane.pdb would be concatenated and saved to a file called all.pdb. All of the text from cubane.pdb, ethane.pdb, methane.pdb, octane.pdb, pentane.pdb and propane.pdb would be printed to the screen and saved to a file called all.pdb. 2.15.31 List unique species Leah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this: 2013-11-05,deer,5 2013-11-05,rabbit,22 2013-11-05,raccoon,7 2013-11-06,rabbit,19 2013-11-06,deer,2 2013-11-06,fox,1 2013-11-07,rabbit,18 2013-11-07,bear,1 An example of this type of file is given in data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt. We can use the command cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq to produce the unique species in animals.txt. In order to avoid having to type out this series of commands every time, a scientist may choose to write a shell script instead. Write a shell script called species.sh that takes any number of filenames as command-line arguments, and uses a variation of the above command to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of those files separately. 2.15.32 Why does history record commands before running them? If you run the command: $ history | tail -n 5 &gt; recent.sh the last command in the file is the history command itself, i.e., the shell has added history to the command log before actually running it. In fact, the shell always adds commands to the log before running them. Why do you think it does this? 2.16 Key Points A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs. The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines. The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be. The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk. Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders). Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree. cd path changes the current working directory. ls path prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the current working directory. pwd prints the user’s current working directory. / on its own is the root directory of the whole file system. A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location. An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system. Directory names in a path are separated with / on Unix, but \\\\ on Windows. .. means ‘the directory above the current one’; . on its own means ‘the current directory’. cp old new copies a file. mkdir path creates a new directory. mv old new moves (renames) a file or directory. rm path removes (deletes) a file. * matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt. ? matches any single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt but not any.txt. Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including Ctrl-X, Control-X, and ^X. The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone. Most files’ names are something.extension. The extension isn’t required and doesn’t guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file. Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano. cat displays the contents of its inputs. head displays the first 10 lines of its input. tail displays the last 10 lines of its input. sort sorts its inputs. wc counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs. command &gt; file redirects a command’s output to a file (overwriting any existing content). command &gt;&gt; file appends a command’s output to a file. &lt; operator redirects input to a command first | second is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second. The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters). A for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list. Every for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on. Use $name to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). ${name} can also be used. Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as ’*’ or ‘?’ in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion. Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping. Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them. Use Ctrl-R to search through the previously entered commands. Use history to display recent commands, and !number to repeat a command by number.

This chapter extends those ideas to show how we can save commands in files to create new tools of our own, and how to use a more powerful version of wildcards to extract data from files. 3.1 How can I create new commands of my own? Loops and history let us do tasks repeatedly, but we can go even further and save commands in files so that we can re-run complex sequences of operations with a few keystrokes. For historical reasons, a file full of shell commands is usually called a shell script, but it is really just another kind of program. Let’s start by going into climate-data and creating a new file called years.sh to hold our shell script: $ cd ~/climate-data $ nano years.sh Insert this line: cut -d , -f 2 cleaned/bellambi_temp.csv This uses the cut command to split the CSV file on commas and select the second field from each line. (The option -d stands for delimiter: we can provide any character we want to split lines on colons, spaces, and so on.) Note that we do not put a dollar sign $ at the front of the line: we have been showing that for interactive commands, but in this case we are putting the command in a file rather than running it immediately. Once we have added this line to the file, we can write it out with Ctrl+O and exit with Ctrl+O. ls shows that our file now exists: $ ls NOTES backup/ cleaned/ raw/ thesis.pdf years.sh README.md bin/ docs/ thesis.md tofu.config and we can check its contents using cat years.sh. More importantly, we can now ask the shell to run this file: $ bash years.sh Year 1997 1997 ...many more lines... 2019 2019 2019 Sure enough, our script’s output is exactly what we would get if we ran the command directly. For example, we can count how many lines of output there are by putting our script in a pipeline: $ bash years.sh | wc -l 8314 What if we want to remove duplicates from the output? The command uniq will do what we want, so let’s edit our script, add it, look at our changes, and then run the modified script: $ nano years.sh $ cat years.sh cut -d , -f 2 cleaned/bellambi_temp.csv | uniq $ bash years.sh Year 1997 1998 1999 ...one line per year... 2017 2018 2019 Once again, we can pipe the output of our script into other commands just as we would pipe the output from any other program: $ bash years.sh | wc -l 24 3.2 How can I make my scripts more versatile? Creating a list of distinct years in a single specific data file isn’t all that useful. What we really want is a way to get the years from any of our files. Let’s edit years.sh again and replace cleaned/bellambi_temp.csv with a special variable $1. Once our change is made, years.sh should contain: cut -d , -f 2 $1 | uniq Inside a shell script, $1 means “the first argument on the command line”. We can now run our script like this: $ bash years.sh cleaned/bellambi_temp.csv and get exactly the same output as before, or give it a different filename: $ bash years.sh cleaned/andamooka_prec.csv and get the years from that file instead. Our little script is now doing something useful, but it may take the next person who reads it a moment to figure out exactly what that is. We can improve our script by adding comments at the top: # Select distinct years from column 2 of climate data file. # Usage: bash years.sh /path/to/file.csv cut -d , -f 2 $1 | uniq As in R, a comment starts with a # character and runs to the end of the line. The computer ignores comments, but they help people (including our future self) understand and use scripts. Let’s make one more change to our script. Instead of always selecting the second column, let’s have it select whatever column the user specified: # Select distinct years from column 2 of climate data file. # Usage: bash years.sh /path/to/file.csv cut -d , -f $2 $1 | uniq The change is very small: we have replaced the fixed column number 2 with a reference to the special variable $2, which is assigned the value of the second command-line argument we give the script when we run it. Let’s check that it works by asking for column 1, which is the weather station ID: $ bash years.sh cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv 1 Station 68228 But we have made a common mistake: we have changed the script without changing the comment. A description that sends readers in the wrong direction is worse than none at all, so we should go back and update it. We should probably also change the script’s name from years.sh to column.sh, since a program’s name is the first piece of documentation anyone sees. And finally, we should add one more command to our pipeline. If we run the script as-is for column 3, which holds months, we get this: $ bash years.sh cleaned/bellambi_prec.csv 3 Month 1 2 … 11 12 1 2 … 8 9 10 Duplicate months aren&#39;t removed because `uniq` only removes *adjacent* duplicates. If we want to get rid of them all, we must sort the data so that redundant lines are next to one another. Here&#39;s our final script: ```text # Select distinct values from a column of a climate data file. # Usage: bash years.sh /path/to/file.csv column_number cut -d , -f $2 $1 | uniq 3.3 How can I turn interactive work into a script? Suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful, such as creating a plot for a paper. Instead of typing those commands into a file in an editor (and potentially getting them wrong) we can run this: $ history 6 &gt; make-figure-3.sh to put the most recent five commands in make-figure-3.sh. 297 bash stats.sh cleaned/*_temp.csv &gt; temperature_stats.csv 298 bash trim-outliers.sh temperature_stats.csv &gt; plot_data.txt 299 date 300 ygraph --format scatter --color bw --borders none plot_data.txt figure-3.png 301 rm temperature_stats.csv plot_data.txt 302 history 6 &gt; make-figure-3.sh It only takes a few moments in an editor to remove the serial numbers and delete the use of date (which prints the current time and date) to create a script that accurately captures what we actually did. This is how we usually develop shell scripts: run commands interactively a few times to make sure they are doing the right thing, then save our recent history to a file and turn that into a reusable script. 3.4 How can I find things in a file? We can use head and tail to select lines from a file by position, but we also often want to select lines that contain certain values. This operation is called filtering When we are working with database tables or dataframes, and in the shell, we usually do it using a command called grep. The name comes from “global regular expression print”, which was a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors. To show how grep works, we will use a file that contains three haikus taken from a 1998 competition in Salon magazine. $ cat haiku.txt The Tao that is seen Is not the true Tao, until You bring fresh toner. With searching comes loss and the presence of absence: &quot;My Thesis&quot; not found. Yesterday it worked Today it is not working Software is like that. Forever, or Five Years We haven’t linked to the original haikus because they don’t appear to be on Salon’s site any longer. As Jeff Rothenberg said, “Digital information lasts forever—or five years, whichever comes first.” Luckily, popular content often has backups. Let’s find lines that contain the word “not”: $ grep not haiku.txt Is not the true Tao, until &quot;My Thesis&quot; not found Today it is not working Here, not is our (very simple) pattern. grep searches the file line by line and shows those lines that contain matches. Let’s search for the pattern The: $ grep The haiku.txt The Tao that is seen &quot;My Thesis&quot; not found. Two lines match, but in one of them, our pattern is part of a larger word Thesis. To restrict matching to lines containing The on its own, we can give grep with the -w option: $ grep -w The haiku.txt The Tao that is seen What if we want to search for a phrase rather than a single word? $ grep is not haiku.txt grep: not: No such file or directory haiku.txt:The Tao that is seen haiku.txt:&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found. haiku.txt:Today it is not working haiku.txt:Software is like that. In this case, grep uses is as the pattern and tries to find it in the files not and haiku.txt. It then tells us that the file not cannot be found, but prints haiku.txt as a prefix to each other line of output to tell us which file those lines came from. If we want to give grep both words as a single argument, we must wrap them in quotation marks: $ grep &quot;is not&quot; haiku.txt Today it is not working Quoting Quotation marks aren’t specific to grep: the shell interprets them before running the command, just as it expands wildcards to create actual filenames no matter what we’re asking it to do. This allows us to do things like head -n 5 \"My Thesis.txt\" if we want to edit a file that has a space in its name. It is also why many programmers write \"$variable\" instead of just $variable when creating loops or shell scripts: if there’s any chance at all that the variable’s value will contain spaces, it’s safest to quote it. grep has many options—so many, in fact, that almost every letter of the alphabet means something to it: $ man grep GREP(1) BSD General Commands Manual GREP(1) NAME grep, egrep, fgrep, zgrep, zegrep, zfgrep -- file pattern searcher SYNOPSIS grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlmnOopqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file] [--binary-files=value] [--color[=when]] [--colour[=when]] [--context[=num]] [--label] [--line-buffered] [--null] [pattern] [file ...] ...more... One of the most useful options is -n, which numbers the lines that match: $ grep -n it haiku.txt 5:With searching comes loss 9:Yesterday it worked 10:Today it is not working Another is -i, which does case-insensitive matching: We can combine options (i.e. flags) as we do with other Unix commands. For example, let’s find the lines that contain the word “the”. We can combine the option -w to find the lines that contain the word “the” and -n to number the lines that match: $ grep -i to haiku.txt You bring fresh toner. Today it is not working We can combine options as with other commands: $ grep -i -n haiku.txt 3:You bring fresh toner. 10:Today it is not working We can also invert the match—i.e., print lines that don’t match the pattern—using -v: $ grep -i -n -v to haiku.txt 1:The Tao that is seen 2:Is not the true Tao, until 4: 5:With searching comes loss 6:and the presence of absence: 7:&quot;My Thesis&quot; not found. 8: 9:Yesterday it worked 11:Software is like that. If we want to search several files at once, all we have to do is give grep all of their names. We will frequently use wildcards to do this, so if we want to count how many records in our climate data come from the year 2001, we can do this: $ grep 2001 cleaned/*.csv | wc -l 2920 Finally, the -r option (for “recursive”) tells grep to search all of the files in or below a directory: $ grep -r . FIXME | wc -l 28 grep‘s real power comes from the fact that its patterns can include a powerful kind of wildcards called regular expressions. For example, this command finds lines that start with the letter ’T’: $ grep -E &quot;^T&quot; haiku.txt The Tao that is seen Today it is not working The -E option tells grep to interpret the pattern as a regular expression rather than taking it literally. The quotes prevent the shell from treating any special characters in the pattern as wildcards, and the ^ in front of the T means, “Only match at the start of the line.” Many tools support regular expressions: we can use them in programming languages, database queries, online search engines, and most text editors (though not Nano—its creators wanted to keep it as small as possible). A wide range of tutorials are available online, and Goyvaerts and Levithan (2012) is a useful companion if you need to go further. 3.5 How can I find files? While grep finds things in files, the find command finds files themselves. It also has a lot of options, but unlike most Unix commands these are written as full words rather than abbreviations. To show how it works, we will explore the docs directory within climate-data: $ cd docs $ tree . . ├── bibliography.bib ├── chapter-1 │ └── index.html ├── chapter-2 │ └── index.html ├── chapter-3 │ └── index.html ├── figures │ ├── figure-1.png │ ├── figure-2.png │ ├── figure-3.png │ └── figure-4.png └── index.html 4 directories, 9 files This directory contains index.html, bibliography.bib, and four subdirectories: three for chapters and one for figures. For our first command, let’s run find . to find and list everything in this directory. (As always, . on its own means the current working directory, which is where we want our search to start.) $ find . . ./index.html ./chapter-1 ./chapter-1/index.html ./figures ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./chapter-3 ./chapter-3/index.html ./chapter-2 ./chapter-2/index.html ./bibliography.bib If we only want to find directories, we can tell find to show us things of type d: $ find . -type d . ./chapter-1 ./figures ./chapter-3 ./chapter-2 If we change -type d to -type f we get a listing of all the files instead: $ find . -type f ./index.html ./chapter-1/index.html ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./chapter-3/index.html ./chapter-2/index.html ./bibliography.bib Now let’s try matching by name: $ find . -name &quot;*.png&quot; ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png ./figures/FIXME.png As we said earlier, the command line’s power lies in combining tools. We have seen how to do that with pipes; let’s use another technique to see how large our HTML files are: $ wc -l $(find . -name &quot;*.html&quot;) 16 ./index.html 14 ./chapter-1/index.html 15 ./chapter-3/index.html 11 ./chapter-2/index.html 56 total When the shell executes this command, it runs whatever is inside the $() and then replaces $() with that command’s output. Since the output of find is the paths of four HTML files, the shell constructs the command: $ wc -l ./index.html ./chapter-1/index.html ./chapter-2/index.html ./chapter-3/index.html which is what we wanted. It is exactly like expanding the wildcard in *.html, but more flexible. We will often use find and grep together. The first finds files whose names match a pattern, while the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern. For example, we can look for the titles of all our HTML files: $ grep &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; $(find . -name &quot;*.html&quot;) ./index.html: &lt;title&gt;Climate Change in the Australian Subcontinent&lt;/title&gt; ./chapter-1/index.html: &lt;title&gt;Climate Change in the Australian Subcontinent: Introduction&lt;/title&gt; ./chapter-3/index.html: &lt;title&gt;Climate Change in the Australian Subcontinent: Methods&lt;/title&gt; ./chapter-2/index.html: &lt;title&gt;Climate Change in the Australian Subcontinent: Background&lt;/title&gt; We can also use $() expansion to create a list of filenames to use in a loop: $ for page in $(find . -name &quot;*.html&quot;) &gt; do &gt; cp $page $page.bak &gt; done $ find . -name &quot;*.bak&quot; ./chapter-1/index.html.bak ./index.html.bak ./chapter-3/index.html.bak ./chapter-2/index.html.bak 3.6 How can I change the shell’s settings? The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables. Those variables control its execution, so by changing their values we can change how the shell and other programs behave. Let’s run the command set and look at some of the variables in a typical shell session: $ set COMPUTERNAME=TURING HOME=/Users/amira HOMEDRIVE=C: HOSTNAME=TURING HOSTTYPE=i686 NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4 OS=Windows_NT PATH=/Users/amira/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin PWD=/Users/amira UID=1000 USERNAME=amira ... There are quite a few—many more than are shown here. And yes, using set to show things might seem a little strange, even for Unix, but if we don’t give it any arguments, it might as well show us things we could set. Every variable has a name. By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names. All shell variables’ values are strings, even those (like UID) that look like numbers. It’s up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary. For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had, it would convert the value of the NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS variable from a string to an integer. Similarly, some variables (like PATH) store lists of values. In this case, the convention is to use a colon ‘:’ as a separator. If a program wants the individual elements of such a list, it’s the program’s responsibility to split the variable’s string value into pieces. Let’s have a closer look at PATH. Its value defines the shell’s search path, i.e., the list of directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs when we type in a program name without specifying what directory it is in. For example, when we type a command like analyze, the shell needs to decide whether to run ./analyze (in our current directory) or /bin/analyze (in a system directory). The rule it uses is simple: the shell checks each directory in the PATH variable in turn, looking for a program with the requested name in that directory. As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program. To show how this works, here are the components of PATH listed one per line: /Users/amira/bin /usr/local/git/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin Suppose that our computer has three programs called analyze: /bin/analyze, /usr/local/bin/analyze, and /Users/amira/analyze. Since the shell searches the directories in the order they’re listed in PATH, it finds /bin/analyze first and runs that. Since /Users/amira is not in our path, Bash will never find the program /Users/amira/analyze unless we type the path in explicitly (for example, as ./analyze if we are in /Users/amira). Let’s show the value of the variable HOME: $ echo HOME HOME Whoops: this just prints “HOME”, which isn’t what we wanted (though it is what we asked for). Let’s try this instead: $ echo $HOME /Users/amira The dollar sign tells the shell that we want the value of the variable named HOME; as we have seen, echo simply prints the literal string HOME if we omit it (because that’s what we want echo to do if we type echo hello or something similar). This works just like wildcards: the shell does the replacement before running the program we’ve asked for. Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is echo /Users/amira, which displays the right thing. Creating a variable is easy—we just assign a value to a name using “=”, and put quotes around the value if it contains spaces or special characters: $ DEPARTMENT=&quot;Library Science&quot; $ echo $DEPARTMENT Library Science To change the value, we just assign a new one: $ DEPARTMENT=&quot;Information Science&quot; $ echo $DEPARTMENT Information Science If we want to set some variables automatically every time we run a shell, we can put commands to do this in a file called .bashrc in our home directory. (The ‘.’ character at the front prevents ls from listing this file unless we specifically ask it to using -a. The “rc” at the end is an abbreviation for “run commands”, which meant something really important decades ago, and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.) For example, here are two lines in /Users/amira/.bashrc: export DEPARTMENT=&quot;Library Science&quot; export TEMP_DIR=/tmp export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup These three lines create the variables DEPARTMENT, TEMP_DIR, and BACKUP_DIR, and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well. Notice that BACKUP_DIR’s definition relies on the value of TEMP_DIR, so that if we change where we put temporary files, our backups will be relocated automatically. While we’re here, it’s also common to use the alias command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type. For example, we can define the alias backup to run /bin/zback with a specific set of arguments: alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR Aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes. The name of an alias can be the same as an existing command, so we can use them to change the behavior of a familiar command: # Long list format including hidden files alias ls=&#39;ls -la&#39; # Print the file paths that were copied/moved alias mv=&#39;mv -v&#39; alias cp=&#39;cp -v&#39; # Print the file paths that were removed # and prompt if trying to remove move than three files alias rm=&#39;rm -Iv&#39; We can find interesting suggestions for other aliases by searching online for “sample bashrc”. 3.7 Summary FIXME: create concept map of advanced shell The original Unix shell was created in 1971, and will soon celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Its syntax may be cryptic and inconsistent, but few programs have lasted as long, and fewer still remain in daily use. The secret to its success was and is its generality: any program that reads text from standard input and prints text to standard output can work with any other. FIXME: write a better summary for advanced shell 3.8 Exercises 3.8.1 Variables in shell scripts In the molecules directory, imagine you have a shell script called script.sh containing the following commands: head -n $2 $1 tail -n $3 $1 While you are in the molecules directory, you type the following command: bash script.sh &#39;*.pdb&#39; 1 1 Which of the following outputs would you expect to see? All of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in .pdb in the molecules directory The first and the last line of each file ending in .pdb in the molecules directory The first and the last line of each file in the molecules directory An error because of the quotes around *.pdb 3.8.2 Find the longest file with a given extension Write a shell script called longest.sh that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory with that extension. For example: $ bash longest.sh /tmp/data pdb would print the name of the .pdb file in /tmp/data that has the most lines. 3.8.3 Script reading comprehension For this question, consider the data-shell/molecules directory once again. This contains a number of .pdb files in addition to any other files you may have created. Explain what each of the following three scripts would do when run as bash script1.sh *.pdb, bash script2.sh *.pdb, and bash script3.sh *.pdb respectively. # Script 1 echo *.* # Script 2 for filename in $1 $2 $3 &gt; do &gt; cat $filename &gt; done # Script 3 echo $@.pdb 3.8.4 Using grep Which command would result in the following output: and the presence of absence: grep \"of\" haiku.txt grep -E \"of\" haiku.txt grep -w \"of\" haiku.txt grep -i \"of\" haiku.txt 3.8.5 Tracking a species Leah has several hundred data files saved in one directory, each of which is formatted like this: 2013-11-05,deer,5 2013-11-05,rabbit,22 2013-11-05,raccoon,7 2013-11-06,rabbit,19 2013-11-06,deer,2 She wants to write a shell script that takes a species as the first command-line argument and a directory as the second argument. The script should return one file called species.txt containing a list of dates and the number of that species seen on each date. For example using the data shown above, rabbit.txt would contain: 2013-11-05,22 2013-11-06,19 Put these commands and pipes in the right order to achieve this: cut -d : -f 2 &gt; | grep -w $1 -r $2 | $1.txt cut -d , -f 1,3 Hint: use man grep to look for how to grep text recursively in a directory and man cut to select more than one field in a line. An example of such a file is provided in data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt 3.8.6 Counting names You and your friend, having just finished reading Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, are in an argument. Of the four sisters in the book, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy, your friend thinks that Jo was the most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Amy. Luckily, you have a file LittleWomen.txt containing the full text of the novel (data-shell/writing/data/LittleWomen.txt). Using a for loop, how would you tabulate the number of times each of the four sisters is mentioned? Hint: one solution might employ the commands grep and wc and a |, while another might utilize grep options. There is often more than one way to solve a programming task, so a particular solution is usually chosen based on a combination of yielding the correct result, elegance, readability, and speed. 3.8.7 Matching and subtracting The -v option to grep inverts pattern matching, so that only lines which do not match the pattern are printed. Given that, which of the following commands will find all files in /data whose names end in s.txt (e.g., animals.txt or planets.txt), but do not contain the word net? Once you have thought about your answer, you can test the commands in the data-shell directory. find data -name '*s.txt' | grep -v net find data -name *s.txt | grep -v net grep -v \"temp\" $(find data -name '*s.txt') None of the above. 3.8.8 find pipeline reading comprehension Write a short explanatory comment for the following shell script: wc -l $(find . -name &#39;*.dat&#39;) | sort -n 3.8.9 Finding files with different properties The find command can be given several other criteria known as “tests” to locate files with specific attributes, such as creation time, size, permissions, or ownership. Use man find to explore these, and then write a single command to find all files in or below the current directory that are owned by the user ahmed and were modified in the last 24 hours. Hint 1: you will need to use three tests: -type, -mtime, and -user. Hint 2: The value for -mtime will need to be negative—why? 3.8.10 Combining options In most command line tools, multiple options can be combined with a single - and no spaces between the options: ls -F -a is equivalent to ls -Fa. FIXME: finish this exercise 3.8.11 Other wildcards FIXME: exercise to introduce ? and other wildcards. 3.9 Key Points Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use. bash filename runs the commands saved in a file. $@ refers to all of a shell script’s command-line arguments. $1, $2, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc. Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them. Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands. find finds files with specific properties that match patterns. grep selects lines in files that match patterns. --help is an option supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs. man command displays the manual page for a given command. $(command) inserts a command’s output in place.

These interfaces are actually wrappers around Git’s original command-line interface, which allows us to access all of Git’s features. This lesson describes how the basic cycle of add, commit, push, and pull works at the command line. 4.1 How can I set up Git for command-line use? On a command line, we write Git commands as git verb options, where the subcommand verb tells Git what we want to do and options provide any additional optional information that subcommand needs. Using this syntax, the first thing we need to do is configure Git: $ git config --global user.name &quot;Frances Bilas&quot; $ git config --global user.email &quot;frances@eniac.org&quot; (Please use your own name and email address instead of the one shown.) Here, config is the verb and the rest of the command are options. We put the name in quotation marks because it contains a space; we don’t actually need to quote the email address, but do so for consistency. Since we are going to be using GitHub, the email address should be the same as the one we used when setting up our GitHub account. These two commands only need to be run once: the flag --global tells Git to use the settings for all of our projects on this computer. We can re-run these commands any time if you want to change our details. We can also check our settings: $ git config --list user.name=Frances Bilas user.email=frances@eniac.org core.autocrlf=input core.editor=nano core.repositoryformatversion=0 core.filemode=true core.bare=false core.ignorecase=true Git Help and Manual If you forget a Git command, we can get a list of the ones available using --help. This option will also give us more information about specific commands. $ git --help $ git config --help 4.2 How can I create a new repository? Once Git is configured, we can start using it. This section will cover how to create a Git repository associated with a project folder. As a running example, we will watch as Frances and her colleague Jean Jennings write a history of the ENIAC project. First, let’s create a directory for our work beneath our home directory and go into it: $ cd ~ $ mkdir eniac $ cd eniac We then tell Git to make this directory a repository, i.e., a place where Git can store versions of our files: $ git init . Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/frances/eniac/.git/ ls seems to show that the directory is still empty: $ ls But if we add the -a flag to show everything, we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within eniac called .git: $ ls -a . .. .git Git stores information about the project in this special subdirectory. If we ever delete it, we will lose that history. We can check that everything is set up correctly by asking Git to tell us the status of our project: $ git status # On branch master # # Initial commit # nothing to commit (create/copy files and use &quot;git add&quot; to track) 4.3 How can I save and track changes? Now that we have a repository for our work, we can add files to it and track their history. Most of the commands we will use (such as git add and git commit) will sound familiar, as the same terminology is used in graphical interfaces like GitKraken and the RStudio IDE. To start, let’s make sure we’re still in the right directory: $ cd ~/eniac Let’s use our favorite text editor to create a file called names.txt that contains the names of the original six ENIAC programmers: Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman Kay Mcnulty Betty Synder (There are some typos and omissions here that we will fix later.) If we check the status of our project, Git tells us that we have a new file: $ git status On branch master No commits yet Untracked files: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed) names.txt nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track) “Untracked files” means there is a file in the directory whose history Git isn’t tracking. We can tell Git to start keeping track of of it using git add: $ git add names.txt and then check that it did what we wanted: $ git status On branch master No commits yet Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) new file: names.txt Git now knows that it’s supposed to keep track of names.txt, but it hasn’t actually recorded any changes yet. To do taht, we need to tell it to commit our work: $ git commit -m &quot;Starting notes on ENIAC personnel&quot; [master (root-commit) 8e966b5] Starting notes on ENIAC personnel 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+) create mode 100644 names.txt When we run git commit, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using git add and stores a copy permanently inside the special .git directory. This permanent copy is called a commit or a revision. In this case, its short identifier is 8e966b5; your commit may have another identifier. We use the -m option (short for message) to record a short descriptive that will remind us later what we did and why. If we just run git commit without the -m option, Git will launch nano (or whatever other editor is configured using git config --global core.editor) so that we can write a longer commit message. Once again, we put the message in double quotes because it contains spaces. If we run git status now, Git tells us that everything is up to date: $ git status On branch master nothing to commit, working directory clean If we want to know what we’ve done recently, we can display the project’s history using git log: $ git log commit 8e966b5f0703d347e4f84817f12b48f456a58ae1 Author: Frances Bilas &lt;frances@eniac.org&gt; Date: Thu Oct 10 09:24:04 2019 -0400 Starting notes on ENIAC personnel git log lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each commit includes the commit’s full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by git commit earlier), the commit’s author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the commit was created. Now suppose Frances goes and corrects the two typos (“Mcnulty” should be “McNulty” and “Synder” should be “Snyder”) so that the file contains this: Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman Kay McNulty Betty Snyder When we run git status now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified: $ git status On branch master Changes not staged for commit: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed) (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory) modified: names.txt no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;) The last line is the key phrase: “no changes added to commit”. We have changed this file, but we haven’t told Git we want to save those changes (which we do with git add) nor have we saved them (which we do with git commit). Let’s do that now. It is good practice to review our changes before saving them, which we can do with git diff. This command shows us the differences between the current state of our repository and the most recently saved version: $ git diff diff --git a/names.txt b/names.txt index deca855..46a1948 100644 --- a/names.txt +++ b/names.txt @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman -Kay Mcnulty -Betty Synder +Kay McNulty +Betty Snyder The output is cryptic (even by the standards of the Unix command line) because it is actually a series of commands telling editors and other tools how to turn the file we had into the file we have. If we break it down into pieces: The first line tells us that Git is producing output in the format of the Unix diff command. The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing: deca855 and 46a1948 are unique computer-generated labels for those versions. The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed; the name appears twice in case we are renaming a file as well as modifying it. The remaining lines show us the changes and the lines on which they occur. A minus sign - in the first column indicates a line that is being removed, while a plus sign + shows a line that is being added. After reviewing our change we can commit it just as we did before: $ git commit -m &quot;Correcting typos in names&quot; On branch master Changes not staged for commit: modified: names.txt no changes added to commit Whoops: we forgot to add the file to the set of things we want to commit. Let’s fix that: $ git add names.txt $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) modified: names.txt $ git commit -m &quot;Correcting typos in names&quot; [master 61d3964] Correcting typos in names 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-) If we are sure we want to commit all of our changes, we can combine git add and git commit into a single command. Let’s add a missing name to the bottom of our file: Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman Kay McNulty Betty Snyder Marlyn Wescoff and then save our work in one step by giving git commit the -a option: $ git commit -a -m &quot;Adding missing name&quot; [master f865209] Adding missing name 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) 4.4 How can I synchronize with other repositories? Sooner or later our computer will experience a hardware failure, be stolen, or be thrown in the lake by someone who thinks we shouldn’t spend the entire vacation working on our thesis. Even before that happens we will probably want to collaborate with others, which we can do by linking our local repository to one stored on a hosting service such as GitHub. The first step in doing that is to create an account on GitHub if we don’t already have one, and then to create a new repository to synchronize with. The remote repository doesn’t have to have the same name as the local one, but we will probably get confused if they are different, so the repository we create on GitHub will also be called eniac. The next step is to connect the two repositories. We do this by making the GitHub repository a remote for the local repository. The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it (Figure 4.1). Figure 4.1: Where to Find the Repository Link We can click on “HTTPS” to change the URL from SSH to HTTPS and then copy that URL. HTTPS vs. SSH We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration. You may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more secure, by following one of the tutorials from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab (the last of which includes a screencast). Next, let’s go into the local eniac repository and run this command: $ git remote add origin https://github.com/frances/eniac.git Make sure to use the URL for your repository instead of the one shown: the only difference should be that it includes your username instead of frances. A Git remote is like a bookmark: it gives a short name to a URL. In this case, the remote’s name is origin; we could use anything we want, but origin is Git’s default, so we will stick with it. We can check that the command has worked by running git remote -v (where the -v option is short for verbose): $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/frances/eniac.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/frances/eniac.git (push) Git displays two lines because it’s actually possible to set up a remote to download from one URL but upload to another. Sensible people don’t do this, so we won’t explore this possibility any further. Once we have set up the remote, we can push the work we have done so far to the repository on GitHub: $ git push origin master This may prompt us to enter our username and password; once we do that, we see a few lines of administrative information: Counting objects: 9, done. Delta compression using up to 4 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done. Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 833 bytes | 277.00 KiB/s, done. Total 9 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0) remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done. To github.com:frances/eniac.git * [new branch] master -&gt; master If we view our GitHub repository in the browser, we will now see that it includes names.txt along with all of the commits we made to create it (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Repository History We can now pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well: $ git pull origin master From https://github.com/frances/eniac * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD Already up-to-date. Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already synchronized. 4.5 How can I explore a project’s history? We have now made three changes to our project. Git lets us look at the previous versions of the project files and restore specific files to earlier states if we want to. To do this, we need to use an identifier that indicates the versions we want. There are two ways to do this, which are similar in spirit to absolute and relative paths. The “absolute” version is the unique identifier that Git gives to each commit. These identifiers are 40 characters long, but in most situations Git will let us use just the first half dozen characters or so. For example, if we run git log right now, it shows us something like this: commit f86520952f1f4ed3751ff407673203a57dab633c Author: Frances Bilas &lt;frances@eniac.org&gt; Date: Thu Oct 10 09:41:24 2019 -0400 Adding missing name commit 61d3964f81a081d80dc49d9610d5bcbe454b2ad6 Author: Frances Bilas &lt;frances@eniac.org&gt; Date: Thu Oct 10 09:38:12 2019 -0400 Correcting typos in names commit 8e966b5f0703d347e4f84817f12b48f456a58ae1 Author: Frances Bilas &lt;frances@eniac.org&gt; Date: Thu Oct 10 09:30:03 2019 -0400 Starting notes on ENIAC personnel If we add a title to the top of names.txt so that it contains: Personnel: Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman Kay McNulty Betty Snyder Marlyn Wescoff then git diff on its own will show the difference between the file as it is and the most recent version: diff --git a/names.txt b/names.txt index 53b863e..fddc85e 100644 --- a/names.txt +++ b/names.txt @@ -1,3 +1,4 @@ +Personnel: Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman but git diff -r 61d3964 shows the difference between the current state and the file as it was after that commit: diff --git a/names.txt b/names.txt index 46a1948..fddc85e 100644 --- a/names.txt +++ b/names.txt @@ -1,5 +1,7 @@ +Personnel: Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman Kay McNulty Betty Snyder +Marlyn Wescoff Note that you may need to use a different identifier than 61d3964.

The “relative” version of history relies on a special identifier called HEAD, which always refers to the most recent version in the repository. git diff -r HEAD (where the option -r is short for revision) shows the same thing as git diff. Instead of typing in a version identifier to back up one commit, though, we can simply use HEAD~1 (where ~ is the tilde symbol). This shorthand is read “HEAD minus one”, and gives us the difference to the previous saved version. git diff -r HEAD~2 goes back two revisions and so on. We can also look at the differences between two saved versions by separating their identifiers with two dots .. like this: $ git diff -r HEAD~1..HEAD~2 diff --git a/names.txt b/names.txt index 46a1948..deca855 100644 --- a/names.txt +++ b/names.txt @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman -Kay McNulty -Betty Snyder +Kay Mcnulty +Betty Synder If we want to see the changes made in a particular commit, we can use git show; we do not need the -r option in this case: $ git show HEAD~2 names.txt commit 8e966b5f0703d347e4f84817f12b48f456a58ae1 Author: Frances Bilas &lt;frances@eniac.org&gt; Date: Thu Oct 10 09:30:03 2019 -0400 Starting notes on ENIAC personnel diff --git a/names.txt b/names.txt new file mode 100644 index 0000000..deca855 --- /dev/null +++ b/names.txt @@ -0,0 +1,5 @@ +Frances Bilas +Jean Jennings +Ruth Lichterman +Kay Mcnulty +Betty Synder 4.6 How can I restore old versions of files? We can see what we changed, but how can we restore it?

Instead, it replaces the content of the file with the old content: $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) modified: names.txt Notice that the changes have already been added to the staging area for new commits. We can bring the file back in sync with the most recent commit using git checkout: $ git checkout HEAD names.txt $ git status On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean $ cat names.txt Frances Bilas Jean Jennings Ruth Lichterman Kay McNulty Betty Snyder Marlyn Wescoff Since we didn’t commit the change in which we added the line Personnel, that work is now lost: Git can only go back and forth between committed versions of files. 4.7 How can I tell Git to ignore some files? We have only modified one file in this tutorial, but everything we have done works just as well with multiple files. Sometimes, though, we don’t want Git to track files’ history. For example, we might want to track text files with names ending in .txt but not data files with names ending in .dat. To stop Git from telling us about these files every time we call git status, we can create a file in the root directory of our project called .gitignore. This file can contain filenames like thesis.pdf or wildcard patterns like *.dat. Each must be on a line of its own, and Git will ignore anything that matches any of these lines. Remember to Ignore Don’t forget to commit .gitignore to your repository so that Git knows to use it. 4.8 Exercises 4.8.1 Places to create Git repositories Along with information about the ENIAC project, Frances would also like to keep some notes on the UNIVAC. Despite her colleagues’ concerns, Frances creates a univac project inside her eniac project as follows: $ cd ~/eniac # go into eniac directory, which is already a Git repository $ mkdir univac # make a subdirectory eniac/univac $ cd univac # go into univac subdirectory $ git init # make univac a Git repository Is the git init command that she runs inside the univac subdirectory required for tracking files stored there? 4.8.2 Committing changes Which command(s) below would save changes to myfile.txt to a local Git repository? $ git commit -m &quot;my recent changes&quot; $ git init myfile.txt $ git commit -m &quot;my recent changes&quot; $ git add myfile.txt $ git commit -m &quot;my recent changes&quot; $ git commit -m myfile.txt &quot;my recent changes&quot; 4.8.3 Committing multiple files The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot. Add some commas to names.txt to separate first and last names. Create a new file old-computers.txt and write a few lines about the first computer you remember seeing or using. Add changes from both files to the staging area and commit those changes. 4.8.4 Write a biography Create a new Git repository on your computer called bio. Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called me.txt and commit your changes. Modify one line and add a fourth line. Display the differences between the file’s original state and its updated state. 4.8.5 Ignoring nested files Suppose our project has a directory results with two subdirectories called data and plots. How would we ignore all of the files in results/plots but not ignore files in results/data? 4.8.6 Including specific files How would you ignore all .dat files in your root directory except for final.dat? (Hint: find out what the exclamation mark ! means in a .gitignore file.) 4.8.7 Exploring the GitHub interface Browse to your eniac repository on GitHub. Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says “NN commits” (where “NN” is some number). Hover over and click on the three buttons to the right of each commit. What information can you gather/explore from these buttons? How would you get that same information in the shell? 4.8.8 GitHub timestamps Create a remote repository on GitHub. Push the contents of your local repository to the remote. Make changes to your local repository and push these changes as well. Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the timestamps of the files. How does GitHub record times, and why? 4.8.9 Push versus commit How is git push different from git commit? 4.8.10 License and README files When we initialized our GitHub repo, we didn’t add a README.md or license file. If we had, what would have happened when we tried to link our local and remote repositories? 4.8.11 Recovering older versions of a file Jennifer made changes this morning to a shell script called data_cruncher.sh that she has been working on for weeks. Her changes broke the script, and she has now spent an hour trying to get it back in working order. Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project’s versions using Git. Which of the commands below can she use torecover the last committed version of her script? $ git checkout HEAD $ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.sh $ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.sh $ git checkout &lt;unique ID of last commit&gt; data_cruncher.sh Both 2 and 4 4.8.12 Workflow and history What is the output of the last command in the sequence below? $ cd eniac $ echo &quot;ENIAC was the world&#39;s first computer.&quot; &gt; history.txt $ git add history.txt $ echo &quot;ENIAC was the world&#39;s first general-purpose electronic computer.&quot; &gt; history.txt $ git commit -m &quot;Origins of ENIAC&quot; $ git checkout HEAD history.txt $ cat history.txt ENIAC was the world&#39;s first computer. ENIAC was the world&#39;s first general-purpose electronic computer. ENIAC was the world&#39;s first computer. ENIAC was the world&#39;s first general-purpose electronic computer. An error message because we have changed history.txt without committing first. 4.8.13 Understanding git diff What will the command git diff HEAD~9 names.txt do if we run it? What does it actually do? What does git diff HEAD names.txt do? 4.8.14 Getting rid of staged changes git checkout can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed? To find out: Change names.txt. git add that change. Use git checkout to see if you can remove your change. Does it work? 4.8.15 Figuring out who did what Run the command git blame names.txt. What does each line of the output show? Why do some lines start with a circumflex ^? 4.9 Key Points Use git config with the --global option to configure a user name, email address, and other preferences once per machine. git init initializes a repository. Git stores all of its repository data in the .git directory. git status shows the status of a repository. git add puts files in the staging area. git commit saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository. The .gitignore file tells Git what files to ignore. git push copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository. git pull copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository. git diff displays differences between commits. git checkout recovers old versions of files.

Branches let us work on multiple things simultaneously in a single repository; pull requests (PRs) let us submit our work for review, get feedback, and make updates. Used together, they allow us to go through the write-review-revise cycle familiar to anyone who has ever written a journal paper in hours rather than weeks. This lesson is derived in part from one created at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We are grateful to its authors for using an open license so that we could repurpose their work. 5.1 What is a branch and how do I create one? The Git lessons so far have all used a sequential timeline: each change builds on the one before, and only on the one before. However, there are times when we want to keep our main work safe from experimental changes. To do this, we can use branches to work on separate tasks in parallel. We can see what branches a repository using this command: $ git branch * master When we initialize a repository, Git automatically creates a branch called [master][git-branch-master]. It is often considered the “official” version of the repository. The asterisk ’*’ indicates that it is currently active, i.e., that all changes we make will take place in this branch by default. (The active branch is like the current working directory in the shell.) Suppose that we are working on an analysis and don’t know whether a violin plot or beeswarm plot will make our results clearer. We decide to create a new branch from master for each and then merge whichever we prefers back to master (Figure 5.1). Figure 5.1: Creating Branches After tossing a coin, we decide to experiment with violin plots first. To create the branch, we run: $ git branch violin We can check that the branch exists by running git branch again: $ git branch * master violin Our branch is there, but the asterisk * shows that we are still in the master branch. (By analogy, creating a new directory doesn’t automatically move us into that directory.) As a further check, let’s see what our repository’s status is: $ git status On branch master nothing to commit, working directory clean To switch to our new branch we can use the checkout command that we first saw in Section 4.6: $ git checkout violin $ git branch master * violin git checkout doesn’t just check out a file from a specific commit: it can also check out the whole repository, i.e., switch it from one saved state to another by updating all files in the repository to match the desired state. A branch is a human-readable name for one such state. We can (and should) choose the name to signal the purpose of the branch, just as we choose the names of files and variables to indicate what they are for. At this point, master and violin are two names for the same repository state (Figure 5.2), so commands like ls and git log shows that the files and history haven’t changed as we switch from master to violin. This will be true until some changes are committed to our new branch. Figure 5.2: Repository State Let’s make such a change by editing our analysis script, adding a lines to create the violin plot, and committing our changes: $ nano bin/analysis.sh $ git add bin/analysis.sh $ git commit -m &quot;Created violin plots&quot; [violin 3ff8195] Created violin plots 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) If we look at the last couple of commits using git log, we see our most recent change: $ git log --oneline -n 2 3ff8195 Created violin plots 64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file (We use --oneline and -n 2 to shorten the log display.) But let’s switch back to the master branch: $ git checkout master $ git branch * master violin If we look at the log, our latest change is not there: $ git log --oneline -n 2 64b802f (HEAD -&gt; master) Adding overdue .gitignore file 2fe5f6f Updating analysis script We have not lost our work: it just isn’t included in this branch (Figure 5.3). We can prove this by switching back to the violin branch and checking the log again: $ git checkout violin $ git log --oneline -n 2 3ff8195 Created violin plots 64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file Figure 5.3: Work Is Not Lost We can also look inside bin/analysis.sh and see our changes. If we make another change and commit it, that change will also go into the violin branch (Figure 5.4): $ nano bin/analysis.sh $ git add . $ git commit -m &quot;Adding facets to the violin plot&quot; [violin db1d03f] Adding facets to the violin plot 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-) Figure 5.4: Change Goes Into Branch And if we want to see the differences between two branches, we can use git diff with the same double-dot .. syntax we use to view differences between two revisions: $ git diff master..violin diff --git a/bin/analysis.sh b/bin/analysis.sh index 8de12fa..bbe78f7 100644 --- a/bin/analysis.sh +++ b/bin/analysis.sh @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ #!/usr/bin/env bash cat $1 | \\ species --all | \\ - plot --default &gt; \\ + plot --violin --facet=species_name &gt; \\ plots/violin-by-species.png We can repeat this process to experiment with beeswarm plots. Since we don’t want to include any of the violin plot work in this branch, we make our new branch from master. To speed things up a bit, we use the -b option to git checkout to create the branch and switch to it in a single step: $ git checkout master # make sure of our starting point $ git checkout -b beeswarm # make branch and switch to it $ nano bin/analysis.sh # make our changes $ git add bin/analysis.sh # add our changes $ git commit -m &quot;Beeswarms&quot; # we really should use a more informative message $ git log --oneline -n 2 # show history 917823d (HEAD -&gt; beeswarm) Beeswarms 64b802f (master) Adding overdue .gitignore file The log shows that the changes in the beeswarm branch are on top of the changes in the master branch, and do not include the changes in the violin branch (Figure 5.5). If we’re curious, we can use git diff to show the differences between the two plotting branches: $ git diff beeswarm..violin diff --git a/bin/analysis.sh b/bin/analysis.sh index 2ebd322..bbe78f7 100644 --- a/bin/analysis.sh +++ b/bin/analysis.sh @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ #!/usr/bin/env bash cat $1 | \\ species --all | \\ - plot --beeswarm --jitter=0.1 --facet=species_name &gt; \\ - plots/beeswarm-by-species.png + plot --violin --facet=species_name &gt; \\ + plots/violin-by-species.png Figure 5.5: Where Changes Are 5.2 How do I merge work from separate branches? After a bit of experimentation, we decide that we prefer violin plots to beeswarm plots. We now have three options: Add our changes to bin/analysis.sh once again in the master branch. Stop working in master and start using the violin branch for future development. Merge the violin and master branches. The first option is tedious and error-prone, while the second option will lead to confusion and doesn’t give us a way to combine changes made in two or more branches. The third option the simplest, fastest, and most reliable. To start, let’s make sure we’re in the master branch: $ git checkout master $ git branch beeswarm * master violin We can now merge the changes in violin branch into our current branch with a single command: $ git merge violin Updating 64b802f..db1d03f Fast-forward bin/analysis.sh | 5 ++++- 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-) Merging doesn’t change the source branch violin (Figure 5.6). Once the merge is done, though, all of the changes made in violin are also in the history of master: $ git log --oneline -n 4 db1d03f (HEAD -&gt; master, violin) Adding facets to the violin plot 3ff8195 Created violin plots 64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file 2fe5f6f Updating analysis script Figure 5.6: Merging Doesn’t Change Things Note that Git automatically creates a new commit (in this case, db1d03f) to represent the merge. If we now run git diff master..violin, Git doesn’t print anything because there aren’t any differences to show. Now that we have merged all of the changes from violin into master there is no need to keep the violin branch, so we can delete it: $ git branch -d violin Deleted branch violin (was db1d03f). And since we don’t want to keep the changes in the beeswarm branch, we can delete it as well: $ git branch -d beeswarm error: The branch &#39;beeswarm&#39; is not fully merged. If you are sure you want to delete it, run &#39;git branch -D beeswarm&#39;. Git refuses to do what we have asked because we have not merged the changes from beeswarm into master (or any other branch), so deleting it actually would erase work. If we are sure we want to do this, we would have to follow Git’s instructions and use the -D option. We won’t do this yet because we can use the changes in the beeswarm branch to illustrate another key feature of Git: handling conflicts. Not Just the Command Line We have been creating, merging, and deleting branches on the command line, but we can do all of these things using GitKraken, the RStudio IDE, and other GUIs. The operations stay the same; all that changes is how we tell the computer what we want to do. 5.3 How do I handle conflicting changes? We now have two branches, master and beeswarm, in which we have changes the same lines of bin/analysis.sh in different ways: $ git diff beeswarm..master diff --git a/bin/analysis.sh b/bin/analysis.sh index 2ebd322..bbe78f7 100644 --- a/bin/analysis.sh +++ b/bin/analysis.sh @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ #!/usr/bin/env bash cat $1 | \\ species --all | \\ - plot --beeswarm --jitter=0.1 --facet=species_name &gt; \\ - plots/beeswarm-by-species.png + plot --violin --facet=species_name &gt; \\ + plots/violin-by-species.png When we try to merge beeswarm into master, Git doesn’t know which of these changes we want to keep. This is called a conflict: $ git merge beeswarm master Auto-merging bin/analysis.sh CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bin/analysis.sh Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. If we look in bin/analysis.sh, we see that Git has kept both sets of changes, but has marked which came from where: $ cat bin/analysis.sh #!/usr/bin/env bash cat $1 | \\ species --all | \\ &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD plot --violin --facet=species_name &gt; \\ plots/violin-by-species.png ======= plot --beeswarm --jitter=0.1 --facet=species_name &gt; \\ plots/beeswarm-by-species.png &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beeswarm The lines from &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD to ======= are what was in master, while the lines from there to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beeswarm show what was in beeswarm. If there were several conflicting regions in the same file, Git would mark each one this way. We have to decide what to do next: keep the master changes, keep those from beeswarm, edit this part of the file to combine them, or write something new. Whatever we do, we must remove the &gt;&gt;&gt;, ===, and &lt;&lt;&lt; markers. Let’s combine the two sets of changes to create side-by-side plots: $ nano bin/analysis.sh $ cat bin/analysis.sh #!/usr/bin/env bash cat $1 | \\ species --all | \\ plot -n 2 --violin --beeswarm --jitter=0.1 --facet=species_name &gt; \\ plots/by-species.png This counts as yet another change to the file: $ git status On branch master All conflicts fixed but you are still merging. (use &quot;git commit&quot; to conclude merge) Changes to be committed: modified: bin/analysis.sh Changes not staged for commit: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed) (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory) modified: bin/analysis.sh Here, Git thinks that there are changes to be committed because of the merge, and that bin/analysis.sh has been modified again because of our edit. Let’s add the file and commit the change: $ git add bin/analysis.sh $ git commit -m &quot;Merging beeswarm plots&quot; [master b0c3fc6] Merging beeswarm plots The project’s history now shows a single sequence of commits, with the beeswarm changes on top of the earlier violin changes: $ git log --oneline b0c3fc6 (HEAD -&gt; master) Merging beeswarm plots 917823d (beeswarm) Beeswarms db1d03f Adding facets to the violin plot 3ff8195 Created violin plots 64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file 2fe5f6f Updating analysis script c89bf68 Northern data dc4adfb Initial commit If we want to see what really happened, we can add the --graph option to git log: $ git log --oneline --graph * b0c3fc6 (HEAD -&gt; master) Merging beeswarm plots |\\ | * 917823d (beeswarm) Beeswarms * | db1d03f Adding facets to the violin plot * | 3ff8195 Created violin plots |/ * 64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file * 2fe5f6f Updating analysis script * c89bf68 Northern data * dc4adfb Initial commit 5.4 How should I use branches? People use Git in different ways, but all of those ways rely heavily on branches. If we are working on our own computer, this workflow will help us keep track of what we are doing: git checkout master to make sure we are in the master branch. git checkout -b name-of-feature to create a new branch. We always create a branch when making changes, since we never know what else might come up. The branch name should be as descriptive as a variable name or filename would be. Make our changes. If something occurs to us along the way—for example, if we are writing a new function and realize that the documentation for some other function should be updated—we do not do that work in this branch just because we happen to be there. Instead, we commit our changes, switch back to master, and create a new branch for the other work. When the new feature is complete, we git merge master name-of-feature to get any changes we merged into master after creating name-of-feature and resolve any conflicts. This is an important step: we want to do the merge and test that everything still works in our feature branch, not in master. Finally, we switch back to master and git merge name-of-feature master to merge our changes into master. We should not have any conflicts, and all of our tests should pass. Most experienced developers use this branch-per-feature workflow, but what exactly is a “feature”? These rules make sense for small projects with or without collaborators: Anything cosmetic that is only one or two lines long can be done in master and committed right away. “Cosmetic” means changes to comments or documentation: nothing that affects how code runs, not even a simple variable renaming. A pure addition that doesn’t change anything else is a feature and goes into a branch. For example, if we run a new analysis and save the results, that should be done on its own branch because it might take several tries to get the analysis to run, and we might interrupt ourselves to fix things that we discover aren’t working. Every change to code that someone might want to undo later in one step gets is a feature. For example, if a new parameter is added to a function, then every call to the function has to be updated. Since neither alteration makes sense without the other, those changes are considered a single feature and should be done in one branch. The hardest thing about using a branch-per-feature workflow is sticking to it for small changes. As the first point in the list above suggests, most people are pragmatic about this on small projects; on large ones, where dozens of people might be committing, even the smallest and most innocuous change needs to be in its own branch so that it can be reviewed (which we discuss below). 5.5 How can I use someone else’s work? So far we have used Git to manage individual work, but it really comes into its own when we are working with other people. We can do this in two ways: Everyone has read and write access to a single shared repository. Everyone can read from the project’s main repository, but only a few people can commit changes to it. The project’s other contributors fork the main repository to create one that they own, do their work in that, and then submit their changes to the main repository. The first approach works well for teams of up to half a dozen people who are all comfortable using Git, but if the project is larger, or if contributors are worried that they might make a mess in the master branch, the second approach is safer. Git itself doesn’t have any notion of a “main repository”, but forges like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket all encourage people to use Git in ways that effectively create one. Suppose, for example, that Frances Bilas has put her plotting project online and that the repository’s URL is https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting. Jean Jennings (another of the original ENIAC programmers) would like to contribute to the project, so she goes to that URL and clicks on the “Fork” button in the upper right corner (Figure 5.7). GitHub immediately creates a copy of Frances’s repository within Jean’s account on GitHub’s own servers. When the command completes, the setup on GitHub now looks like this: Figure 5.7: Forking Nothing has happened yet on Jean’s own machine: the new repository exists only on GitHub. When Jean explores its history, she sees that it contains all of the changes Frances made. A copy of a repository is called a clone. In order to start working on the project, Jean needs to create a clone of her repository (not Frances’s) on her own computer. We will modify Jean’s prompt to include her desktop user ID (jj) and her working directory (initially ~) to make it easier to follow what’s happening: jj:~ $ git clone https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git Cloning into &#39;plotting&#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 32, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (32/32), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (16/16), done. remote: Total 32 (delta 5), reused 32 (delta 5), pack-reused 0 Unpacking objects: 100% (32/32), done. This command creates a new directory with the same name as the project, i.e., plotting. When Jean goes into this directory and runs ls and git log, she sees that all of the project’s files and history are there: jj:~ $ cd plotting jj:~/plotting $ ls README.md bin data jj:~/plotting $ git log --oneline b0c3fc6 Merging beeswarm plots 917823d Beeswarms db1d03f Adding facets to the violin plot 3ff8195 Created violin plots 64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file 2fe5f6f Updating analysis script c89bf68 Northern data dc4adfb Initial commit She also sees that Git has automatically created a remote for her repository that points back at her repository on GitHub: jj:~/plotting $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (push) Frances’s original repository, Jean’s fork on GitHub, and Jean’s new clone on her desktop are now arranged as shown in Figure 5.8. Jean can pull changes from her fork and push work back there, but she needs to do one more thing before she can get changes from Frances’s repository: jj:~/plotting $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git jj:~/plotting $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (push) upstream https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git (push) Figure 5.8: Forked Repositories Jean has called her new remote upstream because it points at the repository hers are derived from. She could use any name, but upstream is a nearly universal convention. With this remote in place, Jean is finally set up (Figure 5.9). Suppose, for example, that Frances has modified the project’s README.md file to add Jean as a contributor. (Again, we show Frances’s user ID and working directory in her prompt to make it clear who’s doing what). Figure 5.9: Finished Forking frances:~/plotting $ pwd /Users/frances/plotting frances:~/plotting $ nano README.md frances:~/plotting $ cat README.md # Plotting Species Distribution Contributors: - Frances Bilas - Jean Jennings Frances commits her changes and pushes them to her repository on GitHub: frances:~/plotting $ git commit -a -m &quot;Adding Jean as a contributor&quot; [master 766c2cd] Adding Jean as a contributor 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+) frances:~/plotting $ git push origin master Counting objects: 3, done.

To https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git b0c3fc6..766c2cd master -&gt; master Figure 5.10: Pull Request The situation is now as shown in (Figure 5.10a), with Frances’s changes on her desktop and in her GitHub repository but not in either of Jean’s repositories. Since Jean has create a remote that points at Frances’s GitHub repository, though, she can easily pull those changes to her desktop (Figure 5.10b): jj:~/plotting $ git pull upstream master remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done. remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1), pack-reused 0 Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

In either case, Git merges the changes and asks us to resolve any conflicts that arise. The only significant difference is that, as with git push and git pull, we have to specify both a remote and a branch: in this case, upstream and master. 5.6 What is a pull request and how do I create one? Jean can now get Frances’s work, but how can Frances get Jean’s? One way would be for Frances to create a remote that pointed at Jean’s repository on GitHub and then pull in Jean’s changes periodically, but that would lead to chaos, since we could never be sure that everyone’s work was in any one place at the same time. Instead, almost everyone uses pull requests instead. Pull requests aren’t part of Git itself, but a great way to collaborate with others using forges like GitHub. A pull request is essentially a note saying, “Someone would like to merge branch A of repository B into branch X of repository Y”. The pull request does not contain the changes, but instead points at two particular branches. If either branch changes, the difference displayed is always up to date (Figure 5.11). Figure 5.11: How Pull Requests Work A pull request can store more than just the source and destination branches: it can also store comments people have made about the proposed merge. GitHub and other forges allow users to comment on the pull request as a whole, or on particular lines, and mark comments as out of date if the author of the pull request updates the code that the comment is attached to (Figure 5.12). It is common for complex changes to go through several rounds of review and revision before being merged. Figure 5.12: Comment Out of Date To see this in action, suppose that Jean wants to add her email address to README.md in the plotting project.

GitHub does that and then displays a page showing the new pull request: Figure 5.17: New Pull Request Note that this pull request is displayed in Frances’s repository rather than Jean’s since it is Frances’s repository that will be affected if the pull request is merged. Some time later, Frances checks her repository and sees that there is a pull request: Figure 5.18: Viewing Pull Request Clicking on the “Pull requests” tab brings up a list of PRs: Figure 5.19: Listing Pull Requests and clicking on the pull link itself displays more information about it: Figure 5.20: Pull Request Details Since there are no conflicts, GitHub will allow Frances to merge the PR immediately using the “Merge pull request” button. She could also discard or reject it without merging using the “Close pull request” button. Instead, she clicks on the “Files changed” tab to see what Jean has changed: Figure 5.21: Files Changed If she moves her mouse over particular lines, a white-on-blue cross appears near the numbers to indicate that she can add comments: Figure 5.22: Comment Marker She clicks on the marker beside her own name and writes a comment: Figure 5.23: Writing Comment She only wants to make one comment rather than write a lengthier multi-comment review, so she clicks on “Add single comment”. GitHub redisplays the page with her comment inserted inline: Figure 5.24: Pull Request With Comment While all of this has been doing on, GitHub has been emailing notifications to both Jean and Frances. When Jean clicks on the link in hers, it takes her to the PR and shows her Frances’s comment. She changes README.md, commits, and pushes, but does not create a new pull request or do anything to the existing one. As explained above, a PR is a note asking that two branches be merged, so if either end of the merge changes, the PR updates automatically. Sure enough, when Frances looks at the PR again a few moments later she sees this: Figure 5.25: Pull Request With Fix Satisfied, she goes back to the “Conversation” tab and clicks on “Merge”.

It’s a little clearer, though, if she also uses git pull from her upstream repository (i.e., Frances’s repository) so that she’s sure to get any other changes that Frances may have merged: jj:~/plotting $ git checkout master Switched to branch &#39;master&#39; Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/master&#39; by 1 commit.

This process may seem overly complicated when it is described step by step, but it quickly becomes second nature. Everyone involved in the project can work at their own pace, picking up others’ changes and submitting their own whenever they want. More importantly, everyone has a chance to review work before it lands in the main repository. As we discuss in Section 6.1, doing reviews doesn’t just prevent errors from creeping in: it is also an effective way to spread understanding and skills. 5.7 How can I label a particular version of my project? A tag is a permanent label on a particular state of the repository. Tags are theoretically redundant, since the full identifier identifies that state as well, but full identifiers are hard to remember and type, and their shortened versions aren’t any more meaningful. Projects therefore use annotated tags to mark every major event in the project’s history. These tags are called “annotated” because they allow their creators to add explanatory messages just like commit messages. For example, a research project could use report-date-event for tag names, such as jse-2018-06-23-response or pediatrics-2018-08-15-summary. If we want to tag the most recent commit in the current branch (i.e., the HEAD), all we have to do is tell Git what name to give the tag: $ git tag -a -m &quot;It is DONE&quot; thesis-final (Please don’t ever actually tempt fate by calling something -final.) The -a option tells Git that we want to annotate the tag, while -m tells it that we’re providing a message on the command line. If we want to see what tags have already been created, we can use git tag on its own. We can also tag an old commit by providing the full identifier after the tag name: $ git tag -a -m &quot;I should have known better&quot; thesis-revisions 8e966b5f0703d347e4f84817f12b48f456a58ae1 Most software projects use [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning] for software releases, which produces three-part version numbers major.minor.patch: Increment major every time there’s an incompatible externally-visible change. Increment minor when adding functionality without breaking any existing code. Increment patch for bug fixes that don’t add any new features (“now works as previously documented”). Simple projects should only tag the master branch because every feature or bug fix is merged to master when it is finished. Larger software projects may create a branch for each released version and do minor or patch updates on that branch, but this is outside the scope of this lesson. 5.8 Exercises 5.8.1 Add new country file and make additional PR Starting in the master branch make a new branch Copy other country file into a new country Edit the file to include info on the new country Add and commit this new file Push the new changes to GitHub 5.9 Key Points git branch creates a new branch where new features can be developed while leaving the master branch untouched. git clone copies a remote repository to create a local repository with a remote called origin automatically set up. Pull requests suggest changes to repos where you don’t have write privileges. Reorganizing code in consistent ways makes errors less likely. Replace a value with a name to make code more readable and to forestall typing errors. Replace a repeated test with a flag to ensure consistency. Turn small pieces of large functions into functions in their own right, even if they are only used once. Combine functions if they are always used together on the same inputs. Use lookup tables to make decision rules easier to follow. Use comprehensions instead of loops.

This is particularly true when we look at programming style. Computers don’t need to understand programs in order to execute them, but people do in order to create them, maintain them, and fix them. The more clearly those programs are laid out, the easier it is to find things and make sense of them. The biggest benefit of having a second person work on a programming project is therefore not getting twice as much code written, but having code reviewed. Study after study over more than 40 years has shown that code review is the most effective way to find bugs in software Fagan (1976),Fagan (1986),Cohen (2010)Bacchelli and Bird (2013). Despite this, it still isn’t common in research software development, in part because it isn’t part of the culture Segal (2005), but also because code review is mostly useful when the reviewers understand the problem domain well enough to comment on algorithms and design choices rather than indentation and variable naming, and the number of people who can do that for a research project is typically very small—sometimes as small as one Petre and Wilson (2014). This lesson will look at the mechanics of code review and present some short examples of the kinds of things reviewers should look for. 6.1 How should I review someone else’s code? How you review is just as important as what you look for: being dismissive or combative are good ways to ensure that people don’t pay attention to your reviews, or avoid having you review their work. Equally, being defensive when someone offers suggestions politely and sincerely is very human, but can stunt your development as a programmer. Lots of people have written guidelines for doing reviews, which are also useful when reviewing written work Quenneville (2018),Sankarram (2018). A few key points are: Work in small increments. As Cohen (2010) and others have found, code review is most effective when done in short bursts. That means that change requests should also be short: anything that’s more than a couple of screens long should be broken into smaller pieces. Look for algorithmic problems first. Code review isn’t just (or even primarily) about style: its real purpose is to find bugs before they can affect anyone. The first pass over any change should therefore look for algorithmic problems. Are the calculations right? Are any rare cases going to be missed? Are errors being caught and handled Chapter ??? Use a rubric. Linters are great, but can’t decide when someone should have used a lookup table instead of conditionals. A list of things to check for can make review faster and more comprehensible, especially when you can copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop specific comments onto specific lines (something that GitHub unfortunately doesn’t yet support). Ask for clarification. If you don’t understand something, or don’t understand why the author did it, ask. (And when the author explains it, think about suggesting that the explanation ought to be documented somewhere.) Offer alternatives. Telling authors that something is wrong is helpful; telling them what they might do instead is more so. Don’t be sarcastic or disparaging. “Did you maybe think about testing this garbage?” is a Code of Conduct violation in any well-run project. Don’t present opinions as facts. “Nobody uses X any more” might be true. If it is, the person making the claim ought to be able to point at download statistics or a Google Trends search; if they can’t, they should say, “I don’t think anybody uses X any more” and explain why they think that. Don’t feign surprise or pass judgment. “Gosh, didn’t you know [some obscure fact]?” isn’t helpful; neither is, “Geez, why don’t you [some clever trick] here?” Don’t overwhelm people with details. If someone has used the letter x as a variable name in several places, and they shouldn’t have, comment on the first two or three and simply put a check beside the others—the reader won’t need the comment repeated. Don’t ask people to do extra work. Nobody enjoys fixing bugs and style violations. Asking them to add a few features while they’re at it is rude. Don’t let people break these rules just because they’re frequent contributors or in positions of power. The culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior it is willing to tolerate Gruenert and Whitaker (2015). If you let people be rude to one another, that is your culture. Be specific in replies to reviewers. If someone has suggested a better variable name, you can probably simply fix it. If someone has suggested a major overhaul to an algorithm, you should reply to their comment to point at the commit that includes the fix. Thank your reviewers. If someone has taken the time to read your code carefully, thank them for doing it. 6.2 How can I check that code follows style guidelines? Checking that code conforms to guidelines like the ones above can be time consuming, but luckily it doesn’t have to be done by hand. Most languages have tools that will check code style rules and report violations. These are often called linters, after an early tool called [lint][lint] that found lint (or fluff) in C code. FIXME: Include text from r-reproducibility about style here. 6.3 How should I collaborate with people when doing code reviews? FIXME: how to review on GitHub. 6.4 In what order should functions be defined? When encountering code for the first time, most people scan it from top to bottom. If that code is a program or script, rather than a library, its main function should be put first, and should probably be called main. After reading that function, someone should have a good idea of what the program does in what order. Three common patterns that people might match against are: Figure out what the user has asked it to do (Chapter ??). Read all input data. Process it. Write output. or: Figure out what the user has asked for. For each input file: Read. Process. Write file-specific output (if any). Write summary output (if any). or: Figure out what the user has asked for. Repeatedly: Wait for user input. Do what the user has asked. Exit when a “stop” command of some sort is received. Each step in each of the outlines above usually becomes a function. Those functions depend on others, some of which are written to break code into comprehensible chunks and are then called just once, others of which are utilities that may be called many times from many different places. FIXME: figure Different people order these differently; our preferred order is: Put all of the single-use functions in the first half of the file in the order in which they are likely to be called. Put all of the multi-use utility functions in the bottom of the file in alphabetical order. If any of those utility functions are used by other scripts or programs, they should go in a file of their own. In fact, this is a good practice even if they’re only used by one program, since it signals even more clearly which functions are in the “structural” layer and which are in the “utility” layer. 6.5 What should I look for when reviewing code? The best way to answer the question in this section’s title is to describe some of the things people should change in their software. Refactoring means changing the structure of code without changing what it does, like refactoring an equation to simplify it. It is just as much a part of programming as writing code in the first place: nobody gets things right the first time Brand (1995), and needs or insights can change over time. Most discussions of refactoring focus on … TODO: Complete for R This lesson describes and motivates some of the most useful patterns; These rules are examples of design patterns: general solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. Knowing them and their names will help you create better software, and also make it easier for you to communicate with your peers. 6.5.1 Do not repeat values Our first and simplest refactoring is called “replace value with name”. It tells us to replace magic numbers with names, i.e., to define constants. This can seem ridiculous in simple cases (why define and use inches_per_foot instead of just writing 12?). However, what may be obvious to you when you’re writing code won’t be obvious to the next person, particularly if they’re working in a different context (most of the world uses the metric system and doesn’t know how many inches are in a foot). It’s also a matter of habit: if you write numbers without explanation in your code for simple cases, you’re more likely to do so for complex cases, and more likely to regret it afterward. Using names instead of raw values also makes it easier to understand code when you read it aloud, which is always a good test of its style. Finally, a single value defined in one place is much easier to change than a bunch of numbers scattered throughout your program. You may not think you will have to change it, but then people want to use your software on Mars and you discover that constants aren’t Mak (2006). TODO: Include R example here. 6.5.2 Do not repeat calculations in loops It’s inefficient to calculate the same value over and over again. It also makes code less readable: if a calculation is inside a loop or a function, readers will assume that it might change each time the code is executed. Our second refactoring, “hoist repeated calculation out of loop”, tells us to move the repeated calculation out of the loop or function. Doing this signals that its value is always the same. And by naming that common value, you help readers understand what its purpose is. TODO: R example 6.5.3 Replace tests with flags to clarify repeated tests Novice programmers frequently write conditional tests like this: if ((a &gt; b) == TRUE) { # ...do something... } The comparison to TRUE is unnecessary because a &gt; b is a Boolean value that is itself either TRUE or FALSE. Like any other value, Booleans can be assigned to variables, and those variables can then be used directly in tests: was_greater = estimate &gt; 0.0 # ...other code that might change estimate... if (was_greater) { # ...do something... } This refactoring is called “replace repeated test with flag”. When it is used, there is no need to write if (was_greater == TRUE): that always produces the same result as if was_greater. Similarly, the equality tests in if was_greater == False is redundant: the expression can simply be written if not was_greater. Creating and using a flag instead of repeating the test is therefore like moving a calculation out of a loop: even if that value is only used once, it makes our intention clearer—these really are the same test. TODO: R example If it takes many lines of code to process data and create a score, and the test then needs to change from &gt; to &gt;=, we’re more likely to get the refactored version right the first time, since the test only appears in one place and its result is given a name. 6.5.4 Handle special cases first A short circuit test is a quick check to handle a special case, such as checking the length of a list of values and returning math.nan for the average if the list is empty. “Place short circuits early” tells us to put short-circuit tests near the start of functions so that readers can mentally remove special cases from their thinking while reading the code that handles the usual case. TODO: R example A related refactoring pattern is called “default and override”. To use it, find cases where a value is set conditionally; assign the default or most common value unconditionally, and then override it in a special case. The result is fewer lines of code and clearer control flow; however, it does mean executing two assignments instead of one, so it shouldn’t be used if the common case is expensive (e.g., involves a database lookup or a web request). TODO: R example 6.5.5 Use functions to make code more comprehensible Functions were created so that programmers could write common operations and re-use them in order to reduce the amount of code that needed to be compiled. Moving complex operations into functions also reduces cognitive load by reducing the number of things that have to be understood simultaneously. TODO: R example You should always extract functions when code can be used in other contests. Even if it can’t, you should extract functions whenever it makes the function clearer when it is read aloud. Multi-part conditionals, parts of long equations, and the bodies of loops are good candidates for extraction; if you can’t think of a plausible name, or if a lot of data has to be passed into the function after it’s extracted, the code should probably be left where it is. Finally, it’s often helpful to keep using the original variable names as parameter names during refactoring to reduce typing. 6.5.6 Combine operations in functions “Combine functions” is the opposite of “extract function”. If operations are always done together, it can sometimes be be more efficient to do them together, and might be easier to understand. However, combining functions often reduces their reusability and readability; one sign that functions shouldn’t have been combined is how often people use the combination and throw some results away. The fragment below shows how two functions can be combined: TODO: R example One thing you may not notice about the combination is that it assumes characters are either vowels or consonants, which means it might work differently than separate calls to the two original functions. Issues like this are why experienced developers write unit tests (Chapter 12) before starting to refactor. 6.5.7 Replace code with data It is sometimes easier to understand and maintain lookup tables than complicated conditionals, so the “create lookup table” refactoring tells us to turn the latter into the former: The more distinct cases there are, the greater the advantage lookup tables have over multi-branch conditionals. Those advantages multiply when items can belong to more than one category, in which case the table is often best written as a dictionary with items as keys and sets of categories as values: The expressions used to update num_vowels and num_consonants make use of the fact that in produces either True or False, which the function int converts to either 1 or 0. We will explore ways of making this code more readable in the exercises. 6.6 Summary There will always be cases where your code will be easier to understand if you don’t do the things described in this lesson, but there are probably fewer of them than you think. FIXME: create concept map for style and review. 6.7 Exercises FIXME: create exercises for review. 6.8 Key Points The brain thinks every difference is significant, so removing unnecessary differences in formatting reduces cognitive load. Python software should always conform to the formatting the rules in PEP 8. Use name=value to define a default value for a function parameter. Use *args to define a catch-all parameter for functions taking a variable number of unnamed arguments. Use **kwargs to define a catch-all parameter for functions taking a variable number of named arguments. Use destructuring to unpack data structures as needed.

It’s easy to run one program to process a single data file, but what happens when our analysis depends on many files, or when we need to re-do the analysis every time new data arrives? What should we do if the analysis has several steps that we have to do in a particular order? If we try to keep track of this ourselves, we will inevitably forget some crucial steps, and it will be hard for other people to pick up our work. Instead, we should use a build tool to keep track of what depends on what and run our analysis programs automatically. These tools were invented to help programmers rebuild complex software, but can be used to automate any workflow. As a running example, we will look at the distribution of word frequencies in classic English novels. Zipf’s Law states that the second most common word in a body of text appears half as often as the most common, the third most common appears a third as often, and so on. To test it, we will use these works from Project Gutenberg: Book Length (words) anne_of_green_gables.txt 105642 common_sense.txt 24999 count_of_monte_cristo.txt 464226 dracula.txt 164424 emma.txt 160458 ethan_frome.txt 37732 frankenstein.txt 78098 jane_eyre.txt 188455 life_of_frederick_douglass.txt 43789 moby_dick.txt 215830 mysterious_affair_at_styles.txt 59604 pride_and_prejudice.txt 124974 sense_and_sensibility.txt 121590 sherlock_holmes.txt 107533 time_machine.txt 35524 treasure_island.txt 71616 The most common words in this corpus appear this many times: Word Count the 97278 and 59385 to 56028 of 55190 I 45680 a 40483 in 30030 was 24512 that 24386 you 22123 it 21420 The frequencies don’t match Zipf’s predictions exactly—for example, we would expect about 48,600 occurrences of “and”—but there certainly seems to be a decay curve of some kind. Our goals are: Analyze one input file to see how well it conforms to Zipf’s Law. Analyze multiple input files to see how well they conform in aggregate. Plot individual and aggregate word frequency distributions and their expected values. Our starting point is: The books are text files in the data/ directory. TODO: number 2 doesn’t make sense for R. We don’t really pipe stuff from the shell. ... reads a text file and creates a CSV file with two columns: a word and how many times the word occurs. We can analyze several files at once by piping them into the program using something like cat data/*.txt | .... (If you don’t know what this means, now would be a good time to review the material on the Unix shell in Chapters 2 and 3). ... takes one or more of these two-column CSV files as input and sums the counts for all occurrences of each word. ... creates a plot that shows word rankings on the X axis and word counts on the Y axis. ... compares actual distributions against theory and give a fitting score. We will use a program called Make to automate our analysis so that every time we add a new book to our data, we can create new plots and update our fits with a single command. Make works as follows: Every time the operating system creates, reads, or changes a file, it updates a timestamp on the file to show when the operation took place. Make can compare these timestamps to figure out whether files are newer or older than one another. A user can describe which files depend on each other by writing rules in a Makefile. For example, one rule could say that results/moby_dick.csv depends on data/moby_dick.txt, while another could say that the plot results/comparison.png depends on all of the CSV files in the results directory. Each rule also tells Make how to update an out-of-date file. For example, the rule for Moby Dick could tell Make to run ... if the result file is older than either the raw data file or the program. When the user runs Make, the program checks all of the rules in the Makefile and runs the commands needed to update any that are out of date. If there are transitive dependencies—i.e., if A depends on B and B depends on C—then Make will trace them through and run all of the commands it needs to in the right order. Alternatives to Make The first version of Make was written in 1976. Programmers have created many replacements for it in the decades since then—so many, in fact, that none have attracted enough users to displace it. If you would like to explore them, check out drake for R. If you want to go deeper, (Smith, 2011) describes the design and implementation of several build tools. 7.0.1 Setting Up This chapter uses a version of Make called GNU Make. It comes with MacOS and Linux, and you can install it on Windows using Chocolatey: $ choco install make 7.0.2 Acknowledgements This chapter is based on the Software Carpentry lesson on Make maintained by Gerard Capes and on Jonathan Dursi’s introduction to pattern rules. 7.1 How can I update a single file using Make? To start, let’s create a file called Makefile in the root of our project: # Regenerate results for &quot;Moby Dick&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv As in the shell and many other programming languages, # indicates that the first line is a comment. The second and third lines form a rule: the target of the rule is results/moby_dick.csv, its single prerequisite is the file data/moby_dick.txt, and the two are separated by a single colon :. The target and prerequisite tell Make what depends on what; the indented line below them describes the action needed to update the target if it is out of date. The action can be one or more shell commands, but each command must be indented by a single tab character: we can’t use spaces or a mix of spaces and tabs. In this rule, the action is “run bin/countwords.py on the raw data file and put the output in a CSV file in the results directory”. To test our rule, run this command in the shell: $ make Make automatically looks for a file called Makefile and follows the rules it contains. In this case, one of three things will happen: If results/moby_dick.csv doesn’t exist, Make runs the action to create it. If data/moby_dick.txt is newer than results/moby_dick.csv, Make runs the action to update the results. If results/moby_dick.csv is newer than its prerequisite, Make does nothing. In the first two cases, Make prints the commands it runs along with anything those command prints to the screen via standard output or standard error. There is no screen output in this case, so we only see the command. Indentation Errors If a Makefile indents a rule with spaces rather than tabs, Make produces an error message like this: Makefile:3: *** missing separator. Stop. No matter what happened the first time we ran make, if we run it again right away it does nothing because our rule’s target is now up to date. It tells us this by displaying the message: make: `results/moby_dick.csv&#39; is up to date. We can check that it is telling the truth by listing the files with their timestamps, ordered by how recently they have been updated: $ ls -l -t data/moby_dick.txt results/moby_dick.csv -rw-r--r-- 1 hamilton staff 219107 31 Dec 08:58 results/moby_dick.csv -rw-r--r-- 1 hamilton staff 1276201 31 Dec 08:58 data/moby_dick.txt As a further test: Delete results/moby_dick.csv and run make again (case #1); Make runs the action. Use touch data/moby_dick.txt to update the timestamp on the data file, then run make (case #2). Again, Make runs the action. 7.2 How can I manage multiple files? Our Makefile isn’t particularly helpful so far, though it does already document exactly how to reproduce one specific result. Let’s add another rule to it: # Regenerate results for &quot;Moby Dick&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv # Regenerate results for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; results/jane_eyre.csv : data/jane_eyre.txt python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv When we run make it tells us: make: `results/moby_dick.csv&#39; is up to date. By default Make only attempts to update the first target it finds in the Makefile, which is called the default target. In this case, the first target is results/moby_dick.csv, which is already up to date. To update something else, we need to tell Make specifically what we want: $ make results/jane_eyre.csv python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv 7.3 How can I update several files at once? If we have to run make once for each result we’re right back where we started. However, we can add a rule to our Makefile to update all of our results at once. The key is to create a phony target that doesn’t correspond to an actual file. Let’s add this line to the top of our Makefile: all : results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv There is no file called all, and this rule doesn’t have any actions of its own, but when we run make all, it creates a list of the things all depends on, then brings each of those prerequisites up to date (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Making Everything As this diagram shows, the order in which rules appear in the Makefile does not necessarily determine the order in which actions are run. Make is free to run commands in any order so long as nothing is updated before its prerequisites are up to date. This is called declarative programming: we declare what outcome we want and the program figures out how to achieve it. We can use phony targets to automate and document all of the tasks in our work. For example, let’s add another target to our Makefile to delete all of the result files we have generated so that we can start afresh. By convention this target is called clean, and ours looks like this: # Remove all generated files. clean : rm -f results/* The -f flag to rm means “force removal”: when we use it, rm won’t complain if the files we have told it to remove are already gone. If we now run: $ make clean Make will delete any results files we have. This is a lot safer than typing rm -f results/* at the command-line, because if we mistakenly put a space after the / and delete all of the files in the project’s root directory, we’ll only make the mistake once. Phony targets are very useful, but there is a catch. Try doing this: $ mkdir clean $ make clean make: `clean&#39; is up to date. Since there is a directory called clean, Make thinks the target clean in the Makefile refers to this directory. Since the rule has no prerequisites, it can’t be out of date, so no actions are executed. We can unconfuse Make by putting this line at the top of Makefile to tell it explicitly which targets are phony: .PHONY : all clean 7.4 How can I update files when programs change? Right now, our Makefile says that each result file depends only on the corresponding data file. But that’s not true: each result also depends on the program used to generate it, and if we change our program, we should regenerate our results. To do that, we can add the program to the prerequisites for each result: # ...phony targets... # Regenerate results for &quot;Moby Dick&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt bin/countwords.py python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv # Regenerate results for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; results/jane_eyre.csv : data/jane_eyre.txt bin/countwords.py python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv $ touch bin/countwords.py $ make all python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv The exercises will explore how we can write a rule to tell us whether our results will be different after a change to a program without actually updating them. Rules like this can help us test our programs: if we don’t think an addition or modification ought to affect the results, but it would, we may have some debugging to do. 7.5 How can I reduce repetition in a Makefile? Our Makefile now mentions bin/countwords.py four times. If we ever change the name of the program or move it to a different location, we will have to find and replace each of those occurrences. More importantly, this redundancy makes our Makefile harder to understand, just as scattering magic numbers through programs makes them harder to understand. The solution is the same one we use in programs: define and use variables. Let’s create names for the word-counting script and the command used to run it: # ...phony targets... COUNT=bin/countwords.py RUN_COUNT=python $(COUNT) # Regenerate results for &quot;Moby Dick&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv # Regenerate results for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; results/jane_eyre.csv : data/jane_eyre.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv Each definition takes the form NAME=value. Variables are written in upper case by convention so that they’ll stand out from filenames (which are usually in lower case), but Make doesn’t require this. What is required is using parentheses to refer to the variable, i.e., to use $(NAME) and not $NAME. For historical reasons, Make interprets $NAME to be a “variable called N followed by the three characers ‘AME’”, If no variable called N exists, $NAME becomes AME, which is almost certainly not what we want. As in programs, variables don’t just cut down on typing. They also signal to readers that several things are always and exactly the same, which reduces cognitive load. 7.6 How can I take specific filenames out of my rules? We could add a third rule to analyze a third novel and a fourth to analyze a fourth, but that clearly wouldn’t scale to analyzing hundreds or thousands of files. Instead, we should write a generic rule that will produce a CSV file for any book. To do this, we need to understand Make’s automatic variables. The first step is to use the very cryptic expression $@ in the rule’s action to mean “the target of the rule”. With it, we can replace this: # Regenerate results for &quot;Moby Dick&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv with this: # Regenerate results for &quot;Moby Dick&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) data/moby_dick.txt &gt; $@ Make defines a value of $@ separately for each rule, so it always refers to that rule’s target. And yes, $@ is an unfortunate name: something like $TARGET would have been easier to understand, but we’re stuck with it now. The next step is to replace the explicit list of prerequisites in the action with the automatic variable $^: # Regenerate results for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) $^ &gt; $@ However, this doesn’t work. The rule’s prerequisites are the novel and the word-counting program. When Make expands the action, the resulting command tries to process the program as if it were a data file: python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt bin/countwords.py &gt; results/moby_dick.csv Make solves this problem with another automatic variable $&lt;, which mean “the first prerequisite”. Using it lets us rewrite our rule as: # Regenerate results for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) $&lt; &gt; $@ $&lt; &gt; $@ is hard to read, even with practice. Using an editor with syntax highlighting (Chapter ??) only helps a little, so please don’t ever create something this cryptic yourself. 7.7 How can I write a generic rule to update many files? We can now replace all the rules for generating results files with one pattern rule using the wildcard %, which matches zero or more characters in a filename. Whatever matches % in the target also matches in the prerequisites, so the rule: results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) $&lt; &gt; $@ will handle Jane Eyre, Moby Dick, The Time Machine, and every other novel in the data directory. (Unfortunately, % cannot be used in rules’ actions, which is why $&lt; and $@ are needed.) With this rule in place, our entire Makefile is reduced to: .PHONY: all clean COUNT=bin/countwords.py RUN_COUNT=python $(COUNT) # Regenerate all results. all : results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv results/time_machine.csv # Regenerate result for any book. results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) $&lt; &gt; $@ # Remove all generated files. clean : rm -f results/* To test our shortened Makefile, let’s delete all of the results files: $ make clean rm -f results/* and then recreate them: $ make all python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv python bin/countwords.py data/time_machine.txt &gt; results/time_machine.csv We can still rebuild individual files if we want, since Make will take the target filename we give on the command line and see if a pattern rule matches it: $ touch data/jane_eyre.txt $ make results/jane_eyre.csv python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv 7.8 How can I automatically define a set of files? Our analysis is still not fully automated: if we add another book to data, we have to remember to add its name to the all target in the Makefile as well. Once again we will fix this in steps. To start, imagine that all the results files already exist and we just want to update them. We can define a variable called RESULTS to be a list of all the results files using the same wildcards we would use in the shell: RESULTS=results/*.csv We can then rewrite all to depend on that list: # Regenerate all results. all : $(RESULTS) However, this only works if the results files already exist: if one doesn’t, its name won’t be included in RESULTS and Make won’t realize that we want to generate it. What we really want is generate the list of results files from the list of books in the data/ directory. We can use a function to do this. The syntax is odd because functions were added to Make long after it was first written, but at least they have readable names. Let’s create a variable DATA that holds the names of all of our data files: DATA=$(wildcard data/*.txt) This calls the function wildcard with the argument data/*.txt. The result is a list of all the text files in the data directory, just as we would get with data/*.txt in the shell. To check that this did the right thing, we can add another phony target called settings that uses the shell command echo to print the names and values of our variables: .PHONY: all clean settings # ...everything else... # Show variables&#39; values. settings : echo COUNT: $(COUNT) echo DATA: $(DATA) Let’s run this: $ make settings echo COUNT: bin/countwords.py COUNT: bin/countwords.py echo DATA: data/common_sense.txt data/jane_eyre.txt data/life_of_frederick_douglass.txt data/moby_dick.txt data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/time_machine.txt DATA: data/common_sense.txt data/jane_eyre.txt data/life_of_frederick_douglass.txt data/moby_dick.txt data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/time_machine.txt The output appears twice because Make shows us the command it’s going to run before running it. If we put @ before the command, Make doesn’t display it, which makes the output easier to read: settings : @echo COUNT: $(COUNT) @echo DATA: $(DATA) $ make settings COUNT: bin/countwords.py DATA: data/common_sense.txt data/jane_eyre.txt data/life_of_frederick_douglass.txt data/moby_dick.txt data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/time_machine.txt We now have the names of our input files, but what we need is the names of the corresponding output files. Make’s patsubst function (short for pattern substitution) does exactly this: RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA)) The first argument to patsubst is the pattern to look, which in this case is a text file in the data directory. We use % to match the stem of the file’s name, which is the part we want to keep. The second argument is the replacement we want. As in a pattern rule, Make replaces % in this argument with whatever matched % in the pattern, which creates the name of the result file we want. Finally, the third argument is what to do the substitution in, which is our list of books’ names. Let’s check our worke by adding another command to the settings target: settings : @echo COUNT: $(COUNT) @echo DATA: $(DATA) @echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS) $ make settings COUNT: bin/countwords.py DATA: data/common_sense.txt data/jane_eyre.txt data/life_of_frederick_douglass.txt data/moby_dick.txt data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/time_machine.txt RESULTS: results/common_sense.csv results/jane_eyre.csv results/life_of_frederick_douglass.csv results/moby_dick.csv results/sense_and_sensibility.csv results/time_machine.csv Excellent: DATA has the names of the files we want to process and RESULTS automatically has the names of the corresponding result files. Let’s recreate all of the latter: $ make clean rm -f results/*.csv $ make all python bin/countwords.py data/common_sense.txt &gt; results/common_sense.csv python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt &gt; results/jane_eyre.csv python bin/countwords.py data/life_of_frederick_douglass.txt &gt; results/life_of_frederick_douglass.csv python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt &gt; results/moby_dick.csv python bin/countwords.py data/sense_and_sensibility.txt &gt; results/sense_and_sensibility.csv python bin/countwords.py data/time_machine.txt &gt; results/time_machine.csv Our workflow is now just two steps: add a data file and run Make. This is a big improvement over running things manually, particularly as we start to add more steps like merging data files and generating plots. 7.9 How can I document my Makefile? Every well-behaved program tells people how to use it (Taschuk and Wilson, 2017). If we run make --help, for example, we get a long list of options that Make understands. How can we document the workflow embodied in a specific Makefile? We could create another phony target called help that prints a list of available commands: .PHONY: all clean help settings # ...other definitions... # Show help. help : @echo &quot;all : regenerate all out-of-date results files.&quot; @echo &quot;results/*.csv : regenerate a particular results file.&quot; @echo &quot;clean : remove all generated files.&quot; @echo &quot;settings : show the values of all variables.&quot; @echo &quot;help : show this message.&quot; Sooner or later, though, we will add a target or rule and forget to update this list. A better approach is to format some comments in a special way and then extract and display those comments when asked to. We’ll use ## (a double comment marker) to indicate the lines we want displayed and grep (Section 3.5) to pull these lines out of the file: .PHONY: all clean help settings COUNT=bin/countwords.py RUN_COUNT=python $(COUNT) DATA=$(wildcard data/*.txt) RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA)) ## all : regenerate all results. all : $(RESULTS) ## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book. results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT) $(RUN_COUNT) $&lt; &gt; $@ ## clean : remove all generated files. clean : rm -f results/*.csv ## settings : show variables&#39; values. settings : @echo COUNT: $(COUNT) @echo DATA: $(DATA) @echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS) ## help : show this message. help : @grep &#39;^##&#39; ./Makefile Let’s test: $ make help ## all : regenerate all results. ## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book. ## clean : remove all generated files. ## settings : show variables&#39; values. ## help : show this message. With a bit more work we ccan remove the ## markers, but this is a good start. 7.10 How can I create entire analysis pipelines? To finish our example, we will automatically generate a collated list of word frequencies. The target is a file called results/collated.csv that depends on the results generated by countwords.py (Figure 7.2). Figure 7.2: Creating Pipelines To create it, we add or change these lines in our Makefile: # ...phony targets and previous variable definitions... COLLATE=bin/collate.py RUN_COLLATE=python $(COLLATE) ## all : regenerate all results. all : results/collated.csv ## results/collated.csv : collate all results. results/collated.csv : $(RESULTS) $(COLLATE) $(RUN_COLLATE) $(RESULTS) &gt; $@ The first two lines tell Make about the collation program, while the change to all tells it what the final target of our pipeline is. Since this target depends on the single-novel results files, make all will regenerate all of those automatically. The rule to regenerate results/collated.csv should look familiar by now: it tells Make that all of the individual results have to be up-to-date and that the final result should be regenerated if the program used to create it has changed. One difference between the action in this rule and the actions we’ve seen before is that this action uses $(RESULTS) directly instead of an automatic variable. We have written the rule this way because there isn’t an automatic variable that means “all but the last prerequisite”, so there’s no way to use automatic variables that wouldn’t result in us trying to process our program. 7.11 Summary Make’s reliance on shell commands instead of direct calls to functions in Python or R sometimes makes it clumsy to use. However, that also makes it very flexible: a single Makefile can run shell commands and programs written in a variety of languages, which makes it a great way to assemble pipelines out of whatever is lying around. Figure 7.3: Automation Concept Map A build tool re-runs commands so all files and their dependencies are up-to-date with each other. Make is a widely-used build tool that uses files’ timestamps to find out-of-date prerequisites. A Make rule has targets, prerequisites, and actions. A target can correspond to a file or be a phony target (used simply to trigger actions). When a target is out of date with respect to its prerequisites, Make executes the actions associated with its rule. Make executes as many rules as it needs to when updating files, but always respect prerequisite order. Make defines the automatic variables $@ (target), $^ (all prerequisites), and $&lt; (first prerequisite). Pattern rules can use % as a placeholder for parts of filenames. Makefiles can define variables using NAME=value. Makefiles can also use functions such as $(wildcard ...) and $(patsubst ...). Specially-formatted comments can be used to make Makefiles self-documenting. 7.12 Exercises 7.12.1 Create a summary results file Add a rule to Makefile to create a summary CSV file from all of the book CSV files. Be careful about writing the prerequisites so that it doesn’t depend on itself. 7.12.2 Generate a plot for the top N words Make it depend on the summary. 7.12.3 Make sure the output directory exists Why is mkdir -p useful? 7.12.4 Report results that would change Write a rule to report which result files would actually change. Hint: use diff. 7.12.5 Create more readable help Modify the command in the help action to remove the leading ‘##’ markers from the output. 7.12.6 The perils of shell wildcards What is wrong with writing the rule for results/collated.csv like this: results/collated.csv : results/*.csv $(RUN_COLLATE) $^ &gt; $@ Hint: the fact that the result no longer depends on the program used to create it isn’t the only problem.

In this section, we’ll help you create a culture of collaboration to help people feel comfortable contributing to your project, as well as develop approaches to manage the progress of the project and team as it develops. These ideas draw on Fogel (2005), which describes how good open source software projects are run, and on Bollier (2014), which explains what a commons is and when it’s the right model to use. We’ll cover both general concepts in managing people and tasks, as well as specific tools that will help you get started; our recommendations refer to the organization methods covered in Section 9 as well as tools from GitHub as described in Section 5. 8.1 Why is it important to ensure everyone feels welcome to contribute? Projects require teams of individuals contributing to the code for sustainable maintenance and growth. Working with a team also increases the functionality and robustness of your code, since more people can offer input into the design and implementation of the project. In order to leverage the power of a group’s expertise and opinions, though, we need to have a mechanism through which people can contribute. Moreover, we need to effectively communicate that project participants enthusiastically desire contributions, and that newcomers to the project are valued regardless of their background or identity. In other words, a supportive environment for contribution depends on recognizing the privilege and consequent oppression that exist in many software development communities, and actively taking steps to ensure everyone feels welcome to contribute. Privilege is an unearned advantage given to some people but not all, while oppression is systemic, pervasive inequality that benefits the privileged and harms those without privilege. A straight, white, physically able, economically secure male is less likely to be interrupted when speaking, more likely to be called on in class, and more likely to get a job interview based on an identical CV than someone who is perceived as being outside these categories. People who are privileged are often not aware of it, as they’ve lived in a system that provides unearned advantages their entire lives. A target is someone who suffers from oppression. Targets are often called “members of a marginalized group”, but that phrasing is deliberately passive. Targets don’t choose to be marginalized: those with privilege marginalize them. An ally is a member of a privileged group who is working to understand their own privilege and end oppression. Encouraging inclusivity is a shared responsibility. As project participants, we should educate ourselves (with lessons like this one), and call out peers who are engaging in marginalizing or oppressive behavior. As project leaders, we should teach participants to be allies and enforcing expectations to encourage an inclusive culture. If we have power, especially the power derived from membership in a majority group, we have the responsibility to be a good allies for members of marginalized groups Aurora and Gardiner (2019). It’s possible for a project to be open to contributors, without actually being welcoming to newcomers. The following sections outline the mindsets and techniques we can use to encourage participation from a diverse community of users and developers. 8.2 Why should we establish a code of conduct for a project? A Code of Conduct is implemented to promote equity and fairness among a group of participants. These guidelines are particularly important for people from marginalized or under-represented groups, who have probably experienced harassment or unwelcoming behavior before. A Code of Conduct is also important when people from very different cultural backgrounds are trying to collaborate, and for newcomers who aren’t familiar with the project rules or workflow. As a whole, a Code of Conduct makes it easier for people to contribute by reducing uncertainty about what behaviors are acceptable. Some people may push back claiming that it’s unnecessary, or that it infringes freedom of speech, but what they really mean is that thinking about how they might have benefited from past inequity makes them feel uncomfortable, or that they like to argue for the sake of arguing. If having a Code of Conduct leads to them going elsewhere, that will probably make our project run more smoothly. Each of us would probably find it very challenging to write a Code of Conduct by ourselves, since we probably can’t anticipate all of the needs of a diverse community of participants. We recommend starting with something that other groups have drafted, refined, and tested in their own communities: the Contributor Covenant for online development projects (like those hosted on GitHub), and the model code of conduct from the Geek Feminism Wiki for in-person events. An effective Code of Conduct should include both expectations for behavior as well as consequences for a failure to comply, since rules are meaningless without a method to enforce them. If we adopt a Code of Conduct, we must be clear about how to report issues, who will receive reports, and how concerns will be addressed. Aurora et al. (2018) is a short, practical guide to handling incidents. As we’ll later discuss in 9.2, information about the Code of Conduct and enforcement is generally found in a file called CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, commonly found alongside other standard files associated with open-source projects. 8.3 Why should we include a license? Codes of Conduct and licenses both play a role in how people interact with our project. While the former describes how contributors interact with each other, the latter dictates how the project can be used and redistributed. Moreover, if the law or a publication agreement prevents people from reading our work or using our software, they can’t contribute, so license selection plays a role in the culture of your project. We may occasionally need to keep things closed in order to respect personally identifiable data or commercial confidentiality, but we default to open to encourage participation within open source projects and to match the values of the project participants. Teams using GitHub and other similar tools should seriously consider what their default should be. Those working strictly in software may not have any problem having everything open. However, teams working with sensitive data, particularly teams with members new to git systems, may wish to keep projects closed during active development. This allows the team to perform checks and make informed selections for what should be released publicly. Supporting open software development is sometimes easier said than done, however, not least because the law hasn’t kept up with everyday practice. Morin et al. (2012) and this blog post are good starting points to understand licensing and intellectual property from a researcher’s point of view, while Lindberg (2008) is a deeper dive for those who want details. While it can depend on your country, institution, and job role, generally creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual property (and thus copyright) protection. Be aware that members of the same team may have different levels of copyright protection. For example, students and faculty may have a copyright on the research work they produce, but staff members may not. Certain employment categories hold that the copyright of the items created during their employment belongs to their employer. This means that every creative work has some sort of license; the only question is whether authors and users know what it is and choose to enforce it. Every project should therefore include an explicit license. This license should be chosen early: changing a license on data, reports, or software can be complicated with unintended consequences. For example, each collaborator may hold copyright on their work and will need to be asked for approval when a license is chosen. Similarly problematic is that changing a license does not change it retroactively. So you may end up with multiple users operating under different licensing structures. Similar to the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file described above and in Section 9.2, the license is usually put in a file called LICENSE.md in the project’s root directory. This file should clearly state the license(s) under which the content is being made available; the plural is used because code, data, and text may be covered by different licenses. Leave It To The Professionals Don’t write your own license. Legalese is a highly technical language, and words don’t mean what you think they do. To make license selection for code as easy as possible, GitHub allows us to select one of the most common software licenses when creating a repository. Note that this does not include common licenses for data or written works, but those can be added in manually. The Open Source Initiative maintains a list of licenses, and choosealicense.com will help us find a license that suits our needs. Some of the things we need to think about are: Do we want to license the work at all? Is the content we are licensing source code? Do we require people distributing derivative works to also distribute their code? Do we want to address patent rights? Is our license compatible with the licenses of the software we depend on? Do our institutions have any policies that may overrule our choices? Are there any copyright experts within our instition who can assist us? 8.3.1 How should we license our software? To answer the questions above for software, we need to understand the difference between two kinds of open software licenses. The two most popular are the MIT License and the GNU Public License (GPL). The MIT License (and its close sibling the BSD License) say that people can do whatever they want to with the software as long as they cite the original source, and that the authors accept no responsibility if things go wrong. The GPL gives people similar rights, but requires them to share their own work on the same terms: You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build &amp; install instructions. — tl;dr We recommend the MIT license: it places the fewest restrictions on future action, it can be made stricter later on, and the last thirty years shows that it’s good enough to keep work open. 8.3.2 How should we license our data and reports? The MIT license and the GPL apply to software. When it comes to data and reports, the most widely used family of licenses are those produced by Creative Commons, which have been written and checked by lawyers and are well understood by the community. The most liberal option is referred to as CC-0, where the “0” stands for “zero restrictions”. This is the public domain declaration, and is not actually a license. CC-0 puts work in the public domain, i.e., allows anyone who wants to use it to do so however they want with no restrictions. This is usually the best choice for data, since it simplifies aggregate analysis. For example, if we choose a license for data that requires people to cite their source, then anyone who uses that data in an analysis must cite us; so must anyone who cites their results, and so on, which quickly becomes unwieldy. However, declaring a dataset to be public domain does not negate the scholarly tradition and requirement of citation and reporting of sources, it just does not legally mandate it. This also means that projects working with aggregated or remixed data have more flexibility with their licensing. The most common license is the Creative Commons—Attribution license, usually referred to as CC-BY. This allows people to do whatever they want to with the work as long as they cite the original source. This is the best license to use for manuscripts, since we want people to share them widely but also want to get credit for our work. Other Creative Commons licenses incorporate various restrictions on specific use cases, using the following abbreviations within their names: ND (no derivative works) prevents people from creating modified versions of our work. Unfortunately, this also inhibits translation and reformatting. SA (share-alike) requires people to share work that incorporates ours on the same terms that we used. Again, it is fine in principle but in practice makes aggregation a headache. Finally, NC (no commercial use) does not mean that people cannot charge money for something that includes our work, though some publishers still try to imply that in order to scare people away from open licensing. Instead, the NC clause means that people cannot charge for something that uses our work without our explicit permission, which we can give under whatever terms we want. 8.4 How can we keep track of the work we still have to do? Defining the Code of Conduct and licensing for our project is an important part of preparing ourselves for other people to contribute to or use our project. Regardless of whether we’re working by ourselves or with a group of people, we’ll need an issue tracking system: a to-do list to keep track of tasks to complete or problems to fix in our project. Issues are sometimes called tickets, so issue tracking systems are sometimes called ticketing systems. They are also often called bug trackers because they were created to keep track of bugs that need fixing. However, they can be used to manage any kind of work and are often a convenient way to manage discussions with project participants as well. Like other forges, GitHub allows participants to create issues for a project, comment on existing issues, and search all available issues. Every issue can hold: A unique ID, such as #123, which is also part of its URL. This makes issues easy to find and refer to: in particular, GitHub automatically turns the expression #123 in a commit message into a link to that issue. A one-line title to aid browsing and search. The issue’s current status. In simple systems (like GitHub’s) each issue is either open or closed, and by default, only open issues are displayed. Closed items are generally removed from default interfaces, so issues should only be closed when they can be completely removed from the team’s attention. The user ID of the issue’s creator, which is written as @name. The IDs of people who have commented on it or modified it are also embedded in the issue’s history, which helps when using issues to manage discussions. The user ID of the person assigned to review the issue, if someone is assigned. A full description that may include screenshots, error messages, and anything else that can be put in a web page. Replies, counter-replies, and so on from people who are interested in the issue. Many of these items are only valuable if the person filing the issue provides useful content. Broadly speaking, people create three kinds of issues: Bug reports to describe problems they have encountered. Feature requests, such as “add this function to this package” or “add a menu to the website”. A feature is what do we want to do next rather than something that needs to be fixed. Questions. Many projects encourage people to ask questions on a mailing list or in a chat channel, but answers given there can be hard to find later, which leads to the same questions coming up over and over again. If people can be persuaded to ask questions by filing issues, and to respond to issues of this kind, then the project’s old issues become a customized Stack Overflow for the project. (Many projects eventually create a page of links to old questions and answers that are particularly helpful.) 8.5 How can I write good bug reports? FIXME: relate to issue templates? The better the bug report, the faster the response, and the more likely the response will actually address the issue Bettenburg et al. (2008). Sometimes the person creating the issue may not know or have the right answer for some of these things, and will be doing their best with limited information about the error. Responding with kindness and encouragement is important to maintain a healthy community, and should be enforced by the project’s code of conduct. Each of these items should be done to the best of your ability. Make sure the problem actually is a bug. It’s always possible that we have called a function the wrong way or done an analysis using the wrong configuration file; if we take a minute to double-check, we could well fix the problem ourselves. Try to come up with a reproducible example or “reprex”. A reprex includes only the steps or lines of code needed to make the problem happen; again, it’s surprising how often we can solve the problem ourselves as we trim down the steps to create one. Write a one-line title for the issue and a longer (but still brief) description that includes relevant details). Attach any screenshots that show the problem, resulting errors, or (slimmed-down) input files needed to re-create it. Describe the version of the software we were using, the operating system we were running on, which version of the programming language you ran it with, and anything else you believe that might affect behavior. Describe each problem separately so that each one can be tackled on its own. This parallels the rule about creating a branch in version control for each bug fix or feature discussed in Section 5. TODO: R example needed? 8.6 How can we use labels to organize work? There is always more work to do than there is time to do it. Issue trackers let project members add labels to issue to manage this. Labels are also often called tags; whatever term is used, they are just a word or two to help users sort and search among tasks. GitHub allows project owners to create any labels they want that users can then add to their issues. A small project should always use some version of these three labels: Bug: something should work but doesn’t. Enhancement: something that someone wants added to the software. Task: something needs to be done, but won’t show up in code (e.g., organizing the next team meeting). Projects also often use: Question: how is something supposed to work? Discussion or Proposal: something the team needs to make a decision about or a concrete proposal to resolve such a discussion. All issues can have discussion—this category is for issues that start that way—but as we’ll discuss in Section 8.9, every project should have clear rules for making decisions. Suitable for Newcomer or Beginner-Friendly: to identify an easy starting point for someone who has just joined the project. If we help potential new contributors find places to start, they are more likely to do so Steinmacher et al. (2014). The labels listed above described what kind of work an issue describes; a separate set of labels can be used to indicate how important that work is. These labels typically have names like High Priority or Low Priority. Once you have an idea of the type of issues and their importance, it’s helpful to use six more labels to record how they will be handled: Urgent: this needs to be done now (and is typically reserved for security fixes). Current: this issue is included in the current round of work. Next: this issue is (probably) going to be included in the next round. Eventually: someone has looked at the issue and believes it needs to be tackled, but there’s no immediate plan to do it. Won’t Fix: someone has decided that the issue isn’t going to be addressed, either because it’s out of scope or because it’s not actually a bug. Once an issue is marked this way, it is usually then closed. This is a great opportunity to provide a kind note explaining why it won’t be addressed and encouragement to continue working with the project. Duplicate: this issue is a duplicate of one that’s already in the system. Again, issues marked this way are usually then closed. Larger projects will replace Current, Next, and Eventually with labels corresponding to upcoming software releases, journal issues, or conferences. This approach works well in the short-term, but can become unwieldy in the long-term if we don’t want to delete labels and can’t otherwise retire them, either (like on GitHub). If we’re planning a project with any expectation of longevity, it’s worth our time to plan our labeling strategy to track the type of issues being filed, their relative importance, and how we handle them. 8.7 How do we decide the priority of certain tasks? The result of the labeling strategy described above is to help triage, which is the process of deciding what is going to be worked on in what order. Prioritizing tasks is never an easy job, and is even more challenging for software development projects that are attempting to balance fixing bugs with creating new features. Luckily, we can leverage systems for planning and prioritization that can make this process easier. Agile is a project management style common to software development projects. This planning style is based on the idea of simultaneous work on different parts of the project to deliver a product over a finite time interval. The project in agile planning is not a piece of technical work, but a product that satisfies a need. A clearly defined project allows us to design a roadmap to project completion, which outlines all features comprising the final product and the deliverables associated with them. To implement the roadmap, agile planning requires identification of time intervals of one to three weeks called [sprints][sprint] that are associated with specific deliverables. Consecutive iterations of planning sprints apply product usage feedback to update the product and integrate all pieces of the final software. A benefit of agile project management is that we can adapt to the needs of the project and respond quickly to feedback. One of the drawbacks is the dependency of different parts of the project to each other, and how we can maximize our effectiveness as a team. An impact/effort matrix is a way of prioritizing the tasks in a project based on two measures: - Impact: the contribution of a task to the end product or goal of the project - Effort: the amount of labor (hours of work) it takes to implement the task For each of these measures, we’ll consider three possible levels: low, medium, and high. Develop a detailed list of tasks for the project, and assign a level for both impact and effort to each task. A common approach is to draw a 3x3 grid (representing levels) label both axes “impact” and “effort”, and place each task on the grid to match the levels identified. Visualizing the impact and effort for each task in relation to the others allows more effective prioritization, delegation, or elimination (if applicable!). FIXME: include figure of 3x3 impact/effort matrix? Both agile planning and an impact/effort matrix are tools for prioritizing tasks. The former helps with long-term planning, while the latter can be used at any point in the process. What we haven’t discussed so far is who actually makes the final decisions in project planning. In a large project, triage is the responsibility of a product manager. In a small one, the project’s lead usually makes triage decisions. Regardless of who is ultimately responsible for the final decision, it helps to include project participants in the planning process. This may be as simple as adding [up-votes][up-vote] and [down-votes][down-vote] to issues to indicate their opinions on importance. Both agile planning and an impact/effort matrix assume working on a team. Performing these activities with the group increases everyone’s investment and sense of ownership to the project plan, which in turn increase their commitment to the plan’s implementation. 8.8 How do we standardize a workflow for the project? Even a clear plan for project priorities can quickly get lost in the shuffle once work gets underway. One of the ways to keep track of who is working on something, or who should be working on something and isn’t, is through implementing a workflow for the project. If we’re working in GitHub, it’s impossible to completely standardize a workflow. However, we can create conventions, define expectations, and use collaborative tools in GitHub to help enforce those conventions. We can leverage our issue tracking system as described in Section 8.6 to manage who can move issues among states, and to which states existing issues can move. For example, Figure 8.1 how issues can move from state to state in a small project: Figure 8.1: Issue Lifecycle An Open issue becomes Assigned when someone is made responsible for it. An Assigned issue becomes Active when that person starts to work on it. If they stop work for any length of time, it becomes Suspended. (That way, people who are waiting for it know not to hold their breath.) An Active bug can either be Fixed or Cancelled, where the latter state means that the person working on it has decided it’s not really a bug. Once a bug is Fixed, it can either be Closed or, if the fix doesn’t work properly, moved back into the Open state and go around again. This part of the workflow involves how individuals manage single issues. We can also use GitHub features to help coordinate longer-term planning, especially related to task assignment. GitHub includes two methods for organizing tasks into categories. First, Github milestones represent a method for grouping issues and pull requests from a single repository. While working on these tasks, GitHub milestones allow you to view progress towards completion as well as the due date. GitHub projects are a more generalized approach to organizing tasks. They can include issues and pull requests from different repositories, as well as notes and reminders for tasks that don’t fit into a project’s issue tracking system. Both of these features provide flexibility to prioritize, plan, and track progress in GitHub. Workflows like this are more complex than small projects need, but when the team is distributed it is essential to be able to find out what’s going on without having to wait for someone to respond to email. Software development projects have lots of moving pieces, representing both individual activities and code as it changes. We should describe the systems we’re using for project organization and management in a CONTRIBUTING.md document, as described in 9.2, so newcomers (and existing participants!) know what to expect. 8.9 How can we make decisions as a group? As the number of participants increases, so does the need for clear direction and transparency in decision-making. These processes represent project [governance][governance], and as we learned in Section 8.1, they determine whether newcomers will feel comfortable contributing. Every team has a power structure: the only question is whether it’s formal and accountable or informal and therefore unaccountable Freeman (1972). The latter can work for groups of up to half a dozen people in which everyone knows everyone else. Beyond that, groups need to spell out who has the authority to make which decisions and how to achieve consensus. Martha’s Rules are a practical lightweight to do this in groups with up to a hundred or so members Minahan (1986). Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an issue in the GitHub repository tagged “proposal”. Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that meeting, and must include: a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue) the full text of the proposal any required background information pros and cons possible alternatives A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present. Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it. The group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their delegate is present. The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the item to the group. After the sponsor presents the proposal, a sense vote is cast for the proposal prior to any discussion: Who likes the proposal? Who can live with the proposal? Who is uncomfortable with the proposal? If all or most of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it is immediately moved to a formal vote with no further discussion. If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is postponed for further rework by the sponsor. If some members are uncomfortable they can briefly state their objections. A timer is then set for a brief discussion moderated by the facilitator. After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add (whichever comes first), the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on the question: “Should we implement this decision over the stated objections?” If a majority votes “yes” the proposal is implemented. Otherwise, the proposal is returned to the sponsor for further work. 8.10 How can we run meetings more efficiently? So far we’ve discussed mainly online tools we can use to work collaboratively with a team of people asynchronously. Circumstances will eventually arise where we feel a need to meet as a group at the same time. Knowing how to run a meeting efficiently is a core skill for anyone who wants to get things done. The rules for running meetings quickly and smoothly are well known but rarely followed: Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting. If the only purpose is to share information, have everyone send a brief email instead. Remember, people can read faster than they can speak: if someone has facts for the rest of the team to absorb, the most polite way to communicate them is to type them in. Write an agenda. If nobody cares enough about the meeting to prepare a point-form list of what’s to be discussed, the meeting itself probably doesn’t need to happen. Note that “the agenda is all the open issues in our GitHub repo” doesn’t count. Include timings in the agenda. Timings help prevent early items stealing time from later ones. The first estimates with any new group are inevitably optimistic, so we should revise them upward for subsequent meetings. However, we shouldn’t have a second or third meeting just because the first one ran over-time: instead, we should try to figure out why we’re running over and fix the underlying problem. Prioritize. Tackle issues that will have high impact but take little time first, and things that will take more time but have less impact later. That way, if the first things run over time, the meeting will still have accomplished something. Make one person responsible for keeping things moving. One person should be made moderator and be responsible for keeping items to time, chiding people who are having side conversations or checking email, and asking people who are talking too much to get to the point. The moderator should not do all the talking; in fact, whoever is in charge will talk less in a well-run meeting than most other participants. This should be a rotating duty among members. Require politeness. No one gets to be rude, no one gets to ramble, and if someone goes off topic, it’s the moderator’s job to say, “Let’s discuss that elsewhere.” No interruptions. Participants should raise a finger, hand, put up a sticky note, or make another well understood gesture to indicate when they want to speak. The moderator should keep track of who wants to speak and give them time in turn. No side conversations. This makes meetings more efficient because Nobody can actually pay attention to two things at once. If distractions are tolerated, people will miss things or they’ll have to be repeated. More importantly, not paying attention is insulting: chatting with a friend while someone explains what they did last week is a really effective way to say, “I don’t think you or your work is important.” Encourage no technology. Encourage everyone put their phones, tablets, and laptops into silent mode, close them, or put them away. When devices are important for taking notes, invite people to disconnect from the network while they take notes. However, respect that people may need to have their phones available if they have a dependent in care, are waiting for a call, need it for 2-factor authentication, or for accessibility needs. So long as the member is full participating, nobody has a right to question why they need their device. Take minutes. Someone other than the moderator should take point-form notes about the most important information that was shared, and about every decision that was made or every task that was assigned to someone. This should be a rotating duty among members. Store your questions in your notes. While other people are talking, participants should take notes of questions they want to ask or points they want to make. (It’s surprising how smart it makes us look when it’s our turn to speak.) End early. If the meeting is scheduled for 10:00-11:00, aim to end at 10:55 to give people time to get where they need to go next. As soon as the meeting is over, circulate the minutes (i.e., emailed them to everyone or post them to a wiki): People who weren’t at the meeting can keep track of what’s going on. We all have to juggle tasks from several projects or courses, which means that sometimes we can’t make it to meetings. A wiki page, email message, or blog entry is a much more efficient way to catch up than asking a team mate, “What did I miss?” Everyone can check what was actually said or promised. More than once, one of us has looked over the minutes of a meeting and thought, “Did I say that?” or, “I didn’t promise to have it ready then!” Accidentally or not, people will often remember things differently; writing them down gives everyone a chance to correct mis-recollection, mis-interpretation, or mis-representation, which can save a lot of anguish later on. People can be held accountable at subsequent meetings. There’s no point making lists of questions and action items if we don’t follow up on them later. If we are using a ticketing system, we should create a ticket for each new question or task right after the meeting and update those that are being carried forward. This helps a lot when the time comes to draw up the agenda for the next meeting. 8.11 How can we keep people from talking too much or too little? One of the risks of a synchronous meeting- either in person or online- is the tendency of some participants to speak far more frequently than is beneficial for the group. Other meeting members may be so accustomed to these types of interactions that they don’t speak up even when they have valuable points to make (which is an example of learned helplessness). One way to combat this is to give everyone three sticky notes at the start of the meeting. Every time they speak, they have to give up one sticky note. When they’re out of stickies, they aren’t allowed to speak until everyone has used at least one, at which point everyone gets all of their sticky notes back. This ensures that nobody talks more than three times as often as the quietest person in the meeting. Balancing the amount of times individuals can speak completely changes group dynamics: people who have given up trying to be heard suddenly have space to contribute, and the overly-frequent speakers realize how unfair they have been. Another useful technique is called interruption bingo. Draw a grid and label the rows and columns with the participants’ names. Each time one person interrupts another, add a tally mark to the appropriate cell; halfway through the meeting, take a moment to look at the results. In most cases it will be clear that one or two people are doing all of the interrupting. After that, saying, “All right, I’m adding another tally to the bingo card,” is often enough to get them to throttle back. Note that this technique is for managing interruptions, not speaking time. It may be completely appropriate for people with more knowledge of a subject to speak about it more often in a meeting, but it is never appropriate to repeatedly cut people off. 8.12 How should we run online meetings? Online meetings provide special challenges, both in the context of regulating how often individuals speak, as well as running meetings in general. This discussion of why online meetings are often frustrating and unproductive points out that in most online meetings, the first person to speak during a pause gets the floor. As a result, “If you have something you want to say, you have to stop listening to the person currently speaking and instead focus on when they’re gonna pause or finish so you can leap into that nanosecond of silence and be the first to utter something. The format…encourages participants who want to contribute to say more and listen less.” The solution is to run a text chat beside the video conference where people can signal that they want to speak. The moderator can then select people from the waiting list. This practice can be reinforced by having everyone mute themselves, and only allowing the moderator to unmute people. Brookfield and Preskill (2016) has many other useful suggestions for managing meetings. 8.13 How should we handle conflict within the team? Working with a group of people brings enormous opportunity, but also ensures the eventual occurrence of conflict. You just missed an important deadline, and people are unhappy. The sick feeling in the pit of your stomach has turned to anger: you did your part, but Marta didn’t finish her stuff until the very last minute, which meant that no one else had time to spot the two big mistakes she’d made. As for Cho, well, he didn’t deliver at all—again. If something doesn’t change, this project is going to pull down your performance review so far that you might have to start looking for a new job. Situations like this come up all the time. Broadly speaking, there are four ways we can deal with them: Cross our fingers and hope that things will get better on their own, even though they didn’t the last three times. Do extra work to make up for others’ shortcomings. This saves us the mental anguish of confronting others in the short run, but the time for that “extra” has to come from somewhere. Sooner or alter, our personal lives or other parts of the project will suffer. Lose our temper. People often wind up displacing anger into other parts of their life: they may yell at someone for taking an extra thirty seconds to make change when what they really need to do is tell their boss that they won’t work through another holiday weekend to make up for management’s decision to short-staff the project. Take constructive steps to fix the underlying problem. Most of us find the first three the easiest to accomplish, though they also carry the unfortunate side effect of amplifying the conflict. Most of us also find number four hard because we don’t like confrontation. If we manage it properly, though, it is a lot less bruising, which means that we don’t have to be as afraid of initiating it. Also, if people believe that we will take steps when they bully, lie, procrastinate, or do a half-assed job, they will usually avoid making it necessary. Make sure we are not guilty of the same sin. We won’t get very far complaining about someone else interrupting in meetings if we do it just as frequently. Check expectations. Are we sure the offender knows what standards they are supposed to be meeting? This is where things like job descriptions or up-front discussion of who’s responsible for what come in handy. Check the situation. Is someone dealing with an ailing parent or immigration woes? Have they been put to work on three other projects that we don’t know about? Use open language when checking in. This gives them the freedom to explain something you may not have expected, and avoids the pressure of being asked directly about something they don’t want to explain. Questions like “Can you help me understand this?” are a good starting point. Document the offense. Write down what the offender has actually done and why it’s not good enough. Doing this helps us clarify what we’re upset about and is absolutely necessary if we have to escalate. Check with other team members. Are we alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down? If so, we aren’t necessarily wrong, but it’ll be a lot easier to fix things if we have the support of the rest of the team. Finding out who else on the team is unhappy can be the hardest part of the whole process, since we can’t even ask the question without letting on that we are upset and word will almost certainly get back to whoever we are asking about, who might then accuse us of stirring up trouble. Talk with the offender. This should be a team effort: put it on the agenda for a team meeting, present the complaint, and make sure that the offender understands it. This is often enough: if someone realizes that they’re going to be called on their hitchhiking or bad manners, they will usually change their ways. Escalate as soon as there’s a second offense. People who don’t have good intentions count on us giving them one last chance after another until the project is finished and they can go suck the life out of their next victim. Don’t fall into this trap. If someone stole a laptop, we would report it right away. If someone steals time, we are being foolishly generous to give them a chance to do it again and again. In the context of a research project, “escalation” often means “taking the issue to our supervisor”. Of course, our supervisor has probably had dozens of students complain to her over the years about teammates not doing their share, and it isn’t uncommon to have both halves of a pair tell the supervisor that they’re doing all the work. (This is yet another reason to use version control: it makes it easy to check who’s actually written what.) In order to get her to take us seriously and help us fix our problem, we should send her an email signed by several people that describes the problem and the steps we have already taken to resolve it. Make sure the offender gets a copy as well, and ask the supervisor to arrange a meeting to resolve the issue. This is where documentation is crucial, both in terms of collaborator guidelines (see ??), as well as tracking progress (see 8.8). Hitchhikers are usually very good at appearing reasonable: they will nod as we present our case, then say, “Well, yes, but…” and list a bunch of minor exceptions or cases where others on the team have also fallen short of expectations. If we can’t back up our complaint, our supervisor will likely be left with the impression that the whole team is dysfunctional, and nothing will improve. 8.14 How can we handle conflict to support an inclusive culture? Conflict associated with workflows and meeting deadlines is challenging and can inhibit the progress on our project. We’re motivated to resolve these conflicts because it’s required to move the project forward. What can we do about conflict that becomes more personal and heated, especially if it relates to violations of our Code of Conduct or value of inclusivity? A few simple guidelines will go a long way: Be short, simple, and firm. Don’t try to be funny: it almost always backfires, or will later be used against us. Play for the audience: we probably won’t change the mind of the oppressor we are calling out, but we might change the minds or give heart to people who are observing. Pick our battles. We can’t challenge everyone, every time, without exhausting ourselves and deafening our audience. An occasional sharp retort will be much more effective than constant criticism. Don’t shame or insult one group when trying to help another. For example, don’t call someone stupid when what we really mean is that they’re racist or homophobic. Change the terms of the debate. The last rule is best explained by example. Suppose someone says, “Why should we take diversity into account when hiring? Why don’t we just hire the best candidate?” Our response could be, “Because taking diversity into account is hiring the best candidate. If you can run a mile in four minutes and someone else can do it in 4:15 with a ball and chain on their leg, who the better athlete? Who will perform better if the impediment is removed? If you intend to preserve an exclusionary culture in this lab, considering how much someone has achieved despite systemic unfairness might not make sense, but you’re not arguing for that, are you?” If they then say, “But it’s not fair to take anything other than technical skill into account when hiring for a technical job,” you can say, “You’re right, which means that what you’re really upset about is the thought that you might be treated the way targets have been treated their whole lives.” Captain Awkward has useful advice for discussions like these, and Charles’ Rules of Argument are very useful online: Don’t go looking for an argument. State your position once, speaking to the audience. Wait for absurd replies. Reply once more to correct any misunderstandings of your original statement. Do not reply again—go do something fun instead. Finally, it’s important to recognize that good principles sometimes conflict. For example, consider this scenario: A manager consistently uses male pronouns to refer to software and people of unknown gender. When you tell them it makes you uncomfortable to treat maleness as the norm, they say that male is the default gender in their first language and you should be more considerate of people from other cultures. On the one hand, we want to respect other people’s cultures; on the other hand, we want to be inclusive of women. In this case, the manager’s discomfort about changing pronouns matters less than the career harm caused by them being exclusionary, but many cases are not this clear cut. Like any written rules, a Code of Conduct requires constant interpretation, and like everything else, discussion about specific cases becomes easier with practice. 8.15 Summary FIXME: summarize teams highlight contributing guidelines, readme, CoC, etc 8.16 Exercises 8.16.1 ggplot2 contributing scavenger hunt Take a look at the ggplot2 GitHub repository.

Project organization is like a diet: everyone has one, it’s just a question of whether it’s healthy or not. In the case of a project, “healthy” means that people can find what they need and do what they want without becoming frustrated. This depends on two things: how well organized the project is, and how familiar people are with that style of organization. As with coding style, small pieces in predictable places with readable names are easier to find and use than large chunks that vary from project to project and have names like “stuff”. While we can be messy while we are working and then tidy up later, experience teaches that we will be more productive if we make tidiness a habit and put things in the right place right from the start. This lesson therefore describes a widely-used template for organizing small and medium-sized data analysis projects Noble (2009). Version First This chapter assumes that a project’s history and development is managed with Git, and that each project lives in a single repository. If you are organizing something messy, please start using version control before you make any changes so that you don’t accidentally lose valuable work. 9.1 What is a project? The first decision we have to make is what exactly constitutes a “project” Wilson et al. (2017). Some examples are: A dataset that is being used by several research projects. The project includes the raw data, the programs used to tidy that data, the tidied data, the extra files needed to make the dataset an R package (Chapter 11), and a few text files describing the data’s authors, license, and provenance. A set of annual reports written for an NGO. The project includes several Jupyter notebooks, some supporting Python libraries used by those notebooks, copies of the HTML and PDF versions of the reports, a text file containing links to the datasets used in the report (which can’t be stored on GitHub since they contain personal identifying information), and a text file explaining details of the analysis that the authors didn’t include in the reports themselves. A software library that provides an interactive glossary of data science terms in both Python and R. The project contains the files needed to create a package in both languages, a Markdown file full of terms and definitions, and a Makefile with targets to check cross-references, compile packages, and so on. More generally, some common criteria for creating projects are one per publication, one per deliverable piece of software, or one per team. The first tends to be too small: a good dataset will result in several reports, and the goal of some projects is to produce a steady stream of reports (such as monthly forecasts). The second is a good fit for software engineering projects whose primary aim is to produce tools rather than results, but can be an awkward fit for data analysis work. The third tends to be too large: a team of half a dozen people may work on many different things at once, and a repository that holds them all quickly looks like someone’s basement. The best rule of thumb for deciding what is and isn’t a project is to ask what people have meetings about. If the same set of people need to get together on a regular basis to talk about something, that “something” probably deserves its own repository. And if the list of people changes slowly over time but the meetings continue, that’s an even stronger sign. 9.2 What files should every project contain? Most projects’ repositories contain four files. Three of these are so widely used in open source software projects that GitHub provides support for them, while the fourth is common in research work. All of these files should be Markdown, and will have a .md suffix (or no suffix at all), and should use the principal names given in upper case since a growing number of tools expect them. README.md includes the project’s title and a one-paragraph description of its purpose or content. GitHub displays the content of this file on the project’s home page. LICENSE (an expectation from CRAN) and LICENSE.md is the project’s license (discussed in Chapter 8.3). CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is its code of conduct (also discussed in Chapter 8.2). CITATION explains how the work should be cited. This file should contains a plain text citation that can be copied and pasted into email, and may also include entries formatted for various bibliographic systems like BibTeX. Other information may be included as sections in these files or put into files of their own: CONTRIBUTORS lists everyone who has contributed to the project. Software projects often put this information in README.md, while research projects make it a section in CITATION. CONTRIBUTING.md explains how to contribute, i.e., what naming conventions to use for functions, what tags to put on issues (Section 5.7), or how to install and configure the software needed to start work on the project. These instructions can also be included as a section in README.md; wherever they go, remember that the easier it is for people to get set up and contribute, the more likely they are to do so Steinmacher et al. (2014). Even the four core files may seem like a lot, but two of these (LICENSE.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) are usually chosen rather than written (Chapter 8.3) and the others (README.md and CITATION) can be quite short to start with. Having these files helps new contributors orient themselves, and also signals that the project is well run. What’s more, much of this content is boilerplate, i.e., the files are copied from one project to another without any changes. Once someone knows that a project is using the MIT License (Section ??) and the Contributor Covenant (Section ??), they don’t need to read the files to know what’s there. 9.3 How should I structure the rest of my project? Noble (2009) described a way to organize small bioinformatics projects that is equally useful for other kinds of research computing. Each project is put in a separate Git repository, and the directories in the root of this repository are organized according to purpose. It specifies five top-level directories: TODO: Redo for R projects as packages. Raw data goes in in ./data-raw/ and is never modified after being stored. Finally, documentation and manuscripts go in ./doc/. Figure 9.1: Project Layout Figure 9.1 below shows this layout for a project called g-trans. A few things to notice are: The documentation for the regulate script appears in the root of ./doc/, while the paper for JCMB is stored in a subdirectory, since it contains several files. There are several subdirectories underneath ./data/ … While the directories in the top level of each project are organized by purpose, the directories within ./data/ …. are organized chronologically to make it easy to see when data was gathered and when results were generated. These directories all have names in ISO date format like YYYY-MM-DD to make it easy to sort them chronologically. This naming is particularly helpful when data and results are used in several reports. At all levels, filenames are chosen so that they will be easy to match with simple shell wildcards. For example, a project might use speciesorgantreatment.csv as a file-naming convention, giving filenames like gorilla_kidney_cm200.csv. This allows gorilla_*_cm200.csv to match all gorilla organs or *_kidney_*.csv to match all kidney data. It does produce long filenames, but tab completion means that we only have to type the full name once. Long filenames are just as easy to match in programs: Python’s glob and R’s Sys.glob will both take a pattern and return a list of matching filenames. Marwick et al. (2018) describes a simple layout: ├── DESCRIPTION ├── README.md ├── LICENSE ├── data │ └── my_data.csv └── vignette └── my_report.Rmd The key differences are: The DESCRIPTION file in the root directory contains the information needed to make the project an R package (Chapter 11). 9.4 How should I manage a mix of compiled programs and scripts? Programming languages come in two flavors: compiled and interpreted. In order to run a program in a compiled language such as C++ or Java, we give the source files to a compiler that translates them into instructions a computer can actually execute and saves those instructions in files (Figure 9.2a). Those files full of instructions can then be re-used as often as we want. If we are using an interpreted language like R, on the other hand, we give our source files to an interpreter. It also translates the code into instructions, but puts those instructions in memory and executes them immediately (Figure 9.2b). Figure 9.2: Language Types Saving instructions in files versus executing them immediately may seem like a small difference, but historically it led to very different styles of programming. Compiled languages usually ran faster than interpreted languages, but compilation took time, so interpreted languages were better for exploratory programming. The differences are much smaller these days than they were twenty years ago, but we do still tend to use compiled languages for anything that has to interact directly with hardware and then wrap those libraries for use in interpreted languages. All of this is preamble to deciding where to put things if a project contains compiled programs. Most software engineers put source code in version control and recompile it as needed to produce executables: It saves disk space. Version control tools can’t diff or merge a compiled program. Compiled programs are much more sensitive to small differences between operating system versions and external dependencies than interpreted programs, so something compiled on one computer might not work on another anyway. As always, the approach matters less than being consistent and including a note in CONTRIBUTING or elsewhere to document the decision. 9.5 How should I document the software in a project? An old proverb says, “Trust, but verify.” The equivalent in programming is, “Be clear, but document.” No matter how well software is written, it always embodies decisions that aren’t explicit in the final code or accommodates complications that aren’t going to be obvious to the next reader. Putting it another way, the best function names in the world aren’t going to answer the questions “Why does the software do this?” and “Why doesn’t it do this in a simpler way?” This lesson will explore who we should write documentation for, what we should write for them, and where it should go. Noble’s layout places documentation and manuscripts in ./docs/. We recommend separating these into ./docs/ and ./reports/: Most projects generate the documentation for their software directly from the source code (Chapters 11 and ??). Putting these files in the same directory as handwritten files has the same problems as putting a compiler’s output in the same directory as handwritten scripts. In fact, it’s often worse, since documentation generators often create many subdirectories and support files. We often create several reports for a single project, which complicates file management even further. There are three kinds of people in any domain: novices, competent practitioners, and experts Wilson (2019a). A novice doesn’t yet have a mental model of the domain; they don’t know what the key terms are, how they relate, what the causes of their problems are, or how to tell whether a solution to their problem is appropriate or not. Competent practitioners know enough to accomplish routine tasks with routine effort: they may need to check Stack Overflow every few minutes, but they know what to search for and what “done” looks like. Finally, experts have such a deep and broad understanding of the domain that they can solve routine problems at a glance and are able to handle the one-in-a-thousand cases that would baffle the merely competent. Each of these three groups needs a different kind of documentation. A novice needs a tutorial that introduces her to key ideas one by one and shows how they fit together. A competent practitioner needs reference guides, cookbooks, and Q&amp;A sites; these give her solutions close enough to what she needs that she can tweak them the rest of the way. Experts need this material as well—nobody’s memory is perfect—but they may also paradoxically want tutorials. The difference between them and novices is that experts want tutorials on how things work and why they were designed that way. The first thing to decide when writing documentation is therefore to decide which of these needs we are trying to meet. Tutorials like this one should be long-form prose that contain code samples and diagrams. They should use authentic tasks to motivate ideas, i.e., show people things they actually want to do rather than printing the numbers from 1 to 10, and should include regular check-ins so that learners and instructors alike can tell if they’re making progress. Tutorials help novices build a mental model, but competent practitioners and experts will be frustrated by their slow pace and low information density. They will want single-point solutions to specific problems like how to find cells in a spreadsheet that contain a certain string or how to configure the web server to load an access control module. They can make use of an alphabetical list of the functions in a library, but are much happier if they can search by keyword to find what they need; one of the signs that someone is no longer a novice is that they’re able to compose useful queries and tell if the results are on the right track or not. That observation brings us to the notion of a false beginner, which is someone who appears not to know anything, but who has enough prior experience in other domains to be able to piece things together much more quickly than a genuine novice. Someone who is proficient with MATLAB, for example, will speed through a tutorial on Python’s numerical libraries much more quickly than someone who has never programmed before. In an ideal world, we would satisfy these needs with a chorus of explanations, some long and detailed, others short and to the point. In our world, though, time and resources are limited, so all but the most popular packages must make do with single explanations. The rest of this section will therefore look at how to create reference guides and FAQs. 9.6 What should I document? The answer to the question in this section’s title depends on what stage of development we are in. If we are doing exploratory programming, a short docstring to remind ourselves of each function’s purpose is good enough. (In fact, it’s probably better than what most people do.) That one- or two-liner should begin with an active verb and describe either how inputs are turned into outputs, or what side effects the function has; as we discuss below, if we need to describe both, we should probably rewrite our function. An active verb is something like “extract”, “normalize”, or “find”. For example, these are all good one-line docstrings: “Create a list of current ages from a list of birth dates.” “Clip signals to lie in [0…1].” “Reduce the red component of each pixel.” We can tell our one-liners are useful if we can read them aloud in the order the functions are called in place of the function’s name and parameters. Once we start writing code for other people—including ourselves three months from now—our docstrings should describe: The name and purpose of every public class, function, and constant in our code. The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function. Any side effects the function has. The type of value returned by every function. What exceptions those functions can raise and when. The word “public” in the first rule is important. We don’t have to write full documentation for helper functions that are only used inside our package and aren’t meant to be called by users, but these should still have at least a comment explaining their purpose. We also don’t have to document unit testing functions: as discussed in Chapter 12, these should have long names that describe what they’re checking so that failure reports are easy to scan. 9.7 How can I create a useful FAQ? An FAQ is a list of frequently-asked questions and corresponding answers. A good FAQ uses the terms and concepts that people bring to the software rather than the vocabulary of its authors; putting it another way, the questions should be things that people might search for online, and the answers should give them enough information to solve their problem. Creating and maintaining a FAQ is a lot of work, and unless the community is large and active, a lot of that effort may turn out to be wasted, because it’s hard for the authors or maintainers of a piece of software to anticipate what newcomers will be mystified by. A better approach is to leverage sites like Stack Overflow, which is where most programmers are going to look for answers anyway: Post every question that someone actually asks us, whether it’s online, by email, or in person. Be sure to include the name of the software package in the question so that it’s findable. Answer the question, making sure to mention which version of the software we’re talking about (so that people can easily spot and discard stale answers in the future). With a bit of work, the Stack Exchange Data Explorer can be used to download questions and answers about our software if we want to put them all in an offline guide. we can also use Stack Printer for this; for example, the URL http://www.stackprinter.com/topvoted?service=stackoverflow&amp;tagged=rstudio will bring up a paged view of top-voted questions about RStudio. Stack Overflow’s guide to asking a good question has been refined over many years, and is a good guide for any project: Write the most specific title we can. Give context before giving sample code. A few sentences to explain what are are trying to do and why will help people determine if their question is a close match to ours or not. Provide a minimal reprex. Section 8.5 explains the value of a reproducible example (reprex), and why reprexes should be as short as possible. TODO: Discuss reprex package. Readers will have a much easier time figuring out if this question and its answers are for them if they can see and understand a few lines of code. Tag, tag, tag. Keywords make everything more findable, from scientific papers and left-handed musical instruments to solutions for programming problems. Use “I” and question words (how/what/when/where/why). The section headings in these lessons follow this rule for the same reason that questions in a FAQ should: writing this way forces us to think more clearly about what someone might actually be thinking when they need help. Keep each item short. The “minimal manual” approach to instructional design Carroll (2014) breaks everything down into single-page steps, with half of that page devoted to troubleshooting. This may feel like baby steps to the person doing the writing, but is often as much as a person searching and reading can handle. It also helps writers realize just how much implicit knowledge they are assuming. Allow for a chorus of explanations. As discussed earlier, users are all different from one another, and are therefore best served by a chorus of explanations. Do not be afraid of providing multiple explanations to a single question that suggest different approaches or are written for different prior levels of understanding. 9.8 How does documentation for data differ from documentation for code? Documenting data is different from code because there’s rarely an element of time within code documentation: we we describe what is there, not how it came to be. Data, on the other hand, always comes from somewhere and has (almost always) had something done to it. Its documentation must therefore include details about process, selection, and transformation. Often, all we need to document data is short action statements to describe the actions taken. Depending on the complexity, the content description and the process information may be contained in the same statement. However, a file that has recieved extensive manual editing and curation should have much more detailed description of what was done. Good tools, like OpenRefine, allow us to export a list of all the changes we have made to a file. This is extremely detailed process information, much like looking at a lenthy series of diffs in version control history, but these change lists do not include why these changes were made. (Some of this may be in version control commit messages, but there may be many changes within a single commit.) For example, documenting that we changed all values like “[1980?]”, “1980?”, and “[[1980]” to “1980” is not enough: the question of “What happened here?” as been answered, but now why. Both pieces must be present for full understanding. 9.9 How should I document the data in a project? To answer the question in this section’s title, think about the questions we would have playing a text adventure game in which we wake up in a room we don’t recognize. We would ask things like: Where am I? What’s around me? What can I do here? Where can I go? We need to know that things exist before we can go investigate them, and the same goes for making our way around data. This is why documentation starts with a README file and a short abstract for the project: they are where most newcomers will start building their expectations around the data. At a minimum, we need to answer questions about content and time. Documentation about content should start with what is available and where things have gone. Newcomers will generally drill down from: Project: what did we do? Dataset: what did we make? Data files: what’s in this file or that column? Datum: where did this value come from? Discussions about what should go into documentation about data will often begin with the end game and ask authors to report absolutely everything that has happened to the data. However, the better place to start would be with anything. Anything is better than nothing and is a useful starting point: improving from something is easier and less daunting than trying to write everything. While a project’s documentation will become more complex over time, the most important requirement at every stage is sustainability: we must design requirements that are still feasible, and still collect useful information, even during crunch times. Multiple styles of material will help different people best (Section 9.7), but most projects do not have the resources to do this. More details are great to have in documentation, but asking for too much risks burnout and no documentation at all. The rules to live by when deciding what should go in are: Documentation should have enough information, about the project, methods, and materials such that the information is maintainable over time, in an accessible format, and valuable for those who need it. Breaking this down: “Enough information” means that some information can always be safely omitted. For example, some methods or computations are best described in published papers; unless those papers are locked behind paywalls, we can link to them instead of duplicating their content. “About the project, methods, and materials” are the elements of most projects that we need to describe. Just like a personal introduction should have our name, pronouns, and position, we should introduce our data by explaining what the project was for, what methods we used in int, and what materials we applied those methods to. “Maintainable” reflects the fact that active projects outgrow static documentation. Since an out-of-date description can be more misleading than no description at all, we should construct documentation in ways that ensure everyone can contribute without it being burdensome. “Accessible format” means two things. First, proprietary formats create barriers to access, since some people may not have access to the software needed to read the documents. They also shorten those documents’ useful lifespan, since manufacturers can change those formats over time. If we do use such a format because we have to integrate with particular systems or because formatting and image embedding are better, we should always make a plain-text copy available as well. The other meaning is accessible to all people. We should use proper markup so screen readers can interact with the structure of the text, provide transcripts for all screencasts or other videos, add alt-text descriptions to images, and ensure that all text is actually rendered so that it can be selected and interacted with. The UK Home Office has published a set of posters that summarize accessibility guidelines and also serve as a great checklist for ensuring access. Finally, “for those who need it” means taking your audience into account when prioritizing what to include and at what level of detail. For example, the documentation for a specialized bioinformatics package could reasonably expect readers to have a graduate-level understanding of the topic, so documentation aimed at high school students may simply not be worth creating. Your Future Self Will Thank You Documentation is often promoted for the good of people reusing data who were not part of creating the data in the first place. Prioritizing their needs can be difficult: how can we justify spending time for other people when our current projects need work fo the good of the people working on them right now? Instead of thinking about people who are unknown and unrelated, we can think about newcomers to our team and the time we will save ourselves in onboarding them. We can also think about the time we will save ourselves when we come back to this project five months or five years from now. Documentation that serves these two groups well will almost certainly serve the needs of strangers as well. These additional rules are taken from (Goodman et al., 2014, @Mich2015, @Hart2016, @Zook2017): Keep raw data raw. Exactly what constitutes “raw” data isn’t always clear: raw data may be the data you downloaded from a repository, or it may come directly from field observations or hardware. Either way, retaining an unchanged version is important for reproducibility, and in case you accidentally overwrite your working copy. The analog inputs to a voltmeter probably don’t need to be recorded on tape if we have the voltmeter’s digitized output. However, our analysis methods and tools can change over time, and even after years of work they can contain bugs. We should therefore keep the original data exactly as we received it so that we can re-do previous analyses or try new ones. This is also a good safeguard if anyone ever questions the integrity of the research: it will be hard to defend ourselves against accusations of fraud if we can’t show our work. Give every part of the data a unique identifier. To aid reproducibility (and save a lot of confusion in conversation), it should be possible to uniquely identify every part of every dataset. This doesn’t mean every cell has to have a unique ID; instead, every datum should have an “address” or location description that can uniquely identify it. For example, a datum may be “in file ACX-02.csv, under column reading_type, in row 450”. To achieve this, the dataset itself should have a DOI (Section 13.1), and within the dataset, every file should have a meaningful name (Section 9.8). Going further, every record should have a unique key within the dataset (Section 13.3): row numbers can change as datasets are sorted, but unique keys that are part of records should always stay in those records. Have a backup plan. Every hard drive eventually fails; the hardware needed to read various storage media eventually becomes unavailable, and there is always the risk that bankruptcy, corporate merger, or a court order will shut down the site we’ve been using to store our data. We should therefore always have a second copy in a different physical and jurisdictional locational. If the primary store is GitHub, copy the data to a secondary online storage provider or onto a USB drive and take it home. If the data contains sensitive information such as personal health records, you must ensure that the storage complies with data privacy regulations and that the data is properly anonymized before it is uploaded to an off-site storage location. Before doing any of this, though, ask your department or institution what facilities they provide. Many academic institutions have some form of institutional repository that data can be uploaded to or a unit whose job it is to handle long term data storage requests. Their staff will also be more familiar with data privacy regulations than most researchers. Test that the backups work. It’s hard to find out how often backups fail—many statistics are inflated by companies selling backup tools—but figures of 15%–25% are often quoted. Restoration failures are particularly common after adding new datasets, changing backup software or procedures, moving to new hardware or new backup locations, or just because it’s Tuesday. We should therefore periodically check that backups can actually be restored, and in particular, that they can be restored by someone other than the person who created them (so that if a password is required, someone else knows what it is). 9.10 How can I get started documenting my data? Writing anything can be difficult, and documentation is no different. Setting up places for information to be housed both formally and informally is the first step; creating a checklist should be the second. The data used within an active project is often rapidly changed, added, or removed. Maintaining and collecting relevant documentation within this phase of constant change can be difficult. One way to tackle this is to keep informal documentation. Creating a parking lot file for each dataset provides a place to jot down notes when things happen. These documents should be the home for quick notes, important links, and any other piece of information we aren’t yet sure what to do with. This takes off the pressure of trying to write formally and well, and avoids the decision fatigue of trying to figure out exactly where everything should go while we’re trying to do something else. Screenshots can also be a quick way to grab a bunch of metadata at once. Whenever we download data from a repository, we can take a screenshot of the landing page we downloaded it from and save the URL (or suggested citation) to the notes file. Any website where we have to fill in query fields, ranges, or other information to get a result is a perfect candidate for a screenshot. A second strategy for dealing with change in active projects is to create a to-do list and assign responsibilities, either as a file in the project’s repository or as a set of tasks in its issue tracking system (Section ??). “Just write documentation” is a large ask of anyone without boundaries or a clear end; like any other element of a research project, establishing a clear scope of work and responsibilities is essential. 9.11 What data documentation should I create first? The first thing to produce when docmenting data is an inventory of what data is available. This inventory collects important informaion for the team during the active collection and analysis process. We start with a bulleted outline of our data collection points. This is different for every domain, but always describes the phases or points within the project that data is collected or produced. For example, a longitudinal study may collect data from subjects during intake and every three weeks following. Using that list, we can fill in the data products being collected in each interaction. The data points being collected are less important than the named instruments, inventories, samples, and so on being collected during each phase. For example, “participant demographic sheet version April 2019” might be all that our team needs. Some of this information may already be available in the detailed descriptions of data collection in project proposals or human subjects review documentation, so the data inventory can start as a bulleted list of these data products with extra notes. The bullet names can be short, but should be meaningful to the team. This can serve as a starting point for describing information already collected and provide a placeholder for work yet to be completed. The following questions should be answered for each data product, but can be answered in any order: Where are any physical representations of this data stored? This is relevant for anything with surveys, samples, specimines, interview sheets, etc. Where are any digital representations of this data stored and what are their file names? Are there any caveats to data collection for this piece of data? Note the details and timeframe for any changes to data collection methods, formatting differences, or any other detail that may make this part of the different or surprising in comparison to the others. The next task is to think about the possible sections of documentation and create a list of relevant sections needed. One problem with general guides is the number of possible sections needed across all domains. Not every section is relevant or valuable for each project, so each team or lab should create its own template for data documentation. This should combine the elements commonly used within their domain and required by their institutions and funders. Each project may then customize the field further and change its customization over time, but this way all the documentation will be similar. This template should be a list of sections with relevant boilerplate text when that makes sense. For example, a lab may have a standard license, contributors’ guide, and code of conduct. This template should be stored under version control so proposed changes can be discussed and changes that are made can be tracked over time. 9.12 How should I manage data that can’t be stored in version control? Small datasets that don’t contain sensitive information should be stored in version control: as a rule of thumb, anything you would send as an email attachment is probably small enough to be put into Git, while anything that might reveal someone’s identity should not be. If data is large or sensitive, there should still be something in ./data/ to show its existence, and that “something” should be easy for programs to read. One option is a CSV file whose columns are: the name of the dataset, its URL or other unique identifier, the date it was last checked, and its size (so that users will have some idea of how much work is involved in processing it). Another option is to have one file per dataset, so that instead of reading gorilla_genome.bam, the program reads gorilla_genome.yml and then uses the url key in that file to find the data it actually wants. Whatever you do, you should always include a README.md file in ./data/ that documents the provenance and organization of the data (Section 13.3). 9.13 Summary FIXME: create concept map for project structure 9.14 Exercises The exercises explore the dataset from Meili (2016) and try to understand the relationship between the study and the included files. Go to the dataset’s page (http://doi.org/10.3886/E17507V2) and download the files. You will need to make an ICPSER account and agree to their data agreement before you can download. See Wickes and Stein (2016). FIXME where should this citation go? 9.14.1 Understand a project Review the dataset’s main page to get a sense of the study. Review the spreadsheet file and the coded response file. Answer the following questions: Who are the participants of this study? What types of data was collected and used for analysis? Can you find information on the demographics of the interviewees? This dataset is clearly in support of an article. What information can you find about it, and can you find a link to it? 9.14.2 Determining the audience for documentation The first step to creting documentation is to think about the audience over time. Not every potential user of the documentation will need it in the short term, so starting with the most immediate users provides some strategic planning for time. Below is a grid of potential audiences and timeframes. These groups are generic and should be adjusted as needed for your project’s domain. For example, some geology and climate data are meant to be preserved for decades, while other projects only have a useful lifespan of a few years. For each potential audience group, mark each box to indicate if that audience group would be in need of the data and in which timeframes. You can repeat marks in each column and row as needed. You may also want to use several types of marks to indicate certainty or uncertainty.

Start with this list and edit to remove, add, or edit sections that would be relevant to your team or project.

Automation tools like Make (Chapter 7) can compile software, run tests, re-do analyses, and re-create reports with a single command; CI tools run those commands and give users feedback every time something changes in the project’s repository. These tools can also be set up to run tests with several different configurations of the software or on several different operating systems, so that (for example) if a programmer makes a change on Windows that would break something for Mac users or vice versa, they find out before their friends’ lives are disrupted. This chapter introduces a CI tool called Travis CI that integrates well with GitHub. If Travis CI has been set up, then every time a change is committed to a GitHub repository, Travis CI creates a fresh environment, checks out a copy of the project, and runs whatever commands the project’s managers have set up. If the project uses a language like C++ or Java, those commands usually start by compiling the source code to create a runnable program (Figure ??). If we want to reassure ourselves that our software works, we can create unit tests as described in Chapter 12 and ask Travis CI to run them as well so that (for example) we know whether the code on a branch is working before we merge it into the master branch (Section 5.2). And if we want to do more, we just have to write the commands. For example, we have Travis CI set up to re-create the PDF and HTML versions of this book every time a pull request is merged. Virtual Machines A virtual machine (VM) is a program that pretends to be a computer. This may seem a bit redundant, but VMs are quick to create and start up, and changes made inside the virtual machine are contained within that VM so we can install new packages or run a completely different operating system without affecting the underlying computer. Every time Travis CI runs, it creates a new virtual machine to ensure that builds and tests run in a completely clean environment: nothing left over from previous attempts to compile, run, or publish will affect the current attempt. 10.1 How do I set up continuous integration? We have to do five things to set up continuous integration: Create an account with Travis CI. Link our Travis CI account to our GitHub account. Tell Travis CI to watch the repository that contains our project. Create a .travis.yml file in your repository to tell Travis CI what language we are working in and what we want to do. Commit that .travis.yml file to the repository. There’s More Than One Way to Do It This process is for general Travis CI usage. If we are working with R projects or packages, we can simplify things considerably using usethis::use_travis (Section 10.3). Creating an account with an online service is a familiar process for most of us, but linking our Travis CI account to our GitHub account may be new. When we do this, we are not only telling Travis CI who we are on GitHub: we are also telling GitHub that it’s OK for Travis CI to get information about us via GitHub’s API. This permission is necessary—without it, we would have to enter our password every time Travis CI wanted to run, which would hardly count as “automated”—but we should always check carefully when authorizing a service like this to make sure we are comfortable with what it is planning to do. 10.1.1 Watching a repository We tell Travis CI about our repository through its website interface. On the left, besides the “My Repositories”, we can click the “+” to add a repository that is already on GitHub (Figure 10.1). After finding our repository in the list that pops up, we flick the switch button so that it is green (Figure 10.2). If our repository doesn’t show up, we can re-synchronize the list using the green “Sync account” button on the left sidebar. If it still doesn’t appear, the repository may belong to someone else or be private. Figure 10.1: ci-add-repo Figure 10.2: ci-list-repos 10.1.2 Setting up a repo TODO: Explain what the travis yml file does in R Travis CI’ summary report tells us whether the build passed, which is shown in green Figure 10.3, or whether it produced warnings or errors, which are shown in red. Figure 10.3: Travis Build Overview The log below this overview contains a wealth of information that can help us debug when the build fails. 10.2 How can I display my project’s status on GitHub? TODO: Can remove, use_travis adds this automatically Once we commit and push thsi change to GitHub, our project will now show the badge for its Travis CI status Figure ??. How Do Badges Work? Badges are much simpler than they first appear. When someone visits our project, GitHub sends them the HTML of the project’s home page. That page includes a link to an image on Travis CI’s site, so our browser sends a request to Travis CI. The URL tells Travis CI’s web server what project we’re interested in; it then sends back a different image depending on the most recently recorded build status for that project. 10.3 How can I set up Travis CI for an R project? The simplest way to set up and use Travis CI with R is to call: usethis::use_travis() This command: Creates a .travis.yml configuration file with typical settings for an R package. Adds a Travis CI build badge to the project’s README.md. Opens the Travis CI page for the package so that we can activate Travis CI for the repository. (This assumes the package is already on GitHub and that we have a Travis CI account.) FIXME: add example here of generated YAML file The usethis documentation has more details, but it really is this simple. 10.4 How can I use Travis CI to test my project? The main reason to set up CI is to test the project every time a change is made. We still have to write unit tests (Chapter 12), but CI makes those tests much more valuable. For R packages, running tests is built into the way R builds in Travis CI, so you as long as you have a tests/ directory, the tests will run. FIXME: Include example here of what failing tests in R look like in Travis CI. With this in place, the Travis CI log located right below the build overview will contain all of the information that our testing command produces when tests fail. We can also have Travis CI report the code coverage of our tests (Section 12.7). This command will set everything up for us: usethis::use_coverage() FIXME: explain what this does to the YAML file. 10.5 How can I use CI for other purposes? Continuous integration was invented for testing, but it can be used to automate almost anything. For example, if we want to create a website for an R package, we can run: usethis::use_pkgdown() usethis::use_pkgdown_travis() to add lines like this to our .travis.yml file: language: R sudo: false cache: packages before_cache: Rscript -e &#39;remotes::install_cran(&quot;pkgdown&quot;)&#39; deploy: provider: script script: Rscript -e &#39;pkgdown::deploy_site_github()&#39; skip_cleanup: true The deploy section tells Travis CI to put the generated website files online using GitHub Pages. FIXME: this section needs more detail. As it is, readers will know something is possible but not how it works or how to debug it when things go wrong. At the least, please explain what keys like before_cache are about and provide a diagram showing what files are produced and copied where. 10.6 Summary FIXME: create concept map for continuous integration. 10.7 Exercises FIXME: Get feedback on this and fill it out more later. Setup Travis CI for the package you’ve been working on (for the course). Get Travis CI to run unit tests of your package (not applicable for R packages). Write a new unit test in your package that you know will fail. Push the changes up to GitHub. Go through the Travis CI log and see what the log says about the failure and how to fix it. Since you made it purposefully fail, you will already know how to fix it, but the point is to get comfortable looking through Travis CI’ logs. Correct the test, push to GitHub, and get Travis CI to build your package successfully. 10.8 Key Points Continuous integration re-builds and/or re-tests software every time something changes. Use continuous integration to to check that software runs correctly and also to run commands for other tasks (e.g., to build a website). Check style as well as correctness.

Another response of the wizards, when faced with a new and unique situation, was to look through their libraries to see if it had ever happened before. This was…a good survival trait. It meant that in times of danger you spent the day sitting very quietly in a building with very thick walls. — Terry Pratchett The more software you write, the more you realize that a programming language is mostly a way to build and combine software packages. Every widely-used language now has an online repository from which people can download and install packages, and sharing yours is a great way to contribute to the community that has helped you get where you are. This lesson shows you how to use R’s tools to do this. CRAN and Alternatives CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, is the best place to find the packages you need. CRAN’s famously strict rules ensure that packages run for everyone, but also makes package development a little more onerous than it might be. You can also share packages directly from GitHub, which many people do while packages are still in development. We will explore this in more detail below. 11.1.1 Exercise: What packages do you have? What R packages are currently installed on your computer? How did you figure this out? 11.1.2 Exercise: Can you build a package? Clone the GitHub repository for the here package at https://github.com/r-lib/here. Open here.Rproj in RStudio. Build the package. Does the package build successfully? What messages do you see? Do any of them worry you? 11.2 What is a package, exactly? Suppose you have written a useful R script and want to share it with colleagues. You could email it to them (or point them at the GitHub repository it’s in), but what should they do next? They could copy the file onto their computer, but then they would have to decide where to put it and remember their decision later on when you updated the script to fix a few bugs. And what about the documentation you so lovingly crafted—where should it go? Oh, and what if different people decide to organize their files differently—how hard will it be to make the things they have built play nicely together? Packages solve these problems. While the details vary from language to language, packages always require that information about the software be stored in a specific format and in a specific location, so that statements like library(something) know where to find what they need. They are rather like the USB ports of the software world: anything that conforms to a few simple rules can plug in to anything else. 11.3 How do I create a package? An R package must contain the following files: The text file DESCRIPTION (with no suffix) describes what the package does, who wrote it, and what other packages it requires to run. We will edit its contents as we go along. NAMESPACE, (whose name also has no suffix) contains the names of everything exported from the package (i.e., everything that is visible to the outside world). As we will see, we should leave its management in the hands of RStudio and the devtools package we will meet below. Just as .gitignore tells Git what files in a project to ignore, .Rbuildignore tells R which files to include or not include in the package. All of the R source for our package must go in a directory called R; subdirectories below this are not allowed. As you would expect from its name, the optional data directory contains any data we have put in our package. In order for it to be loadable as part of the package, the data must be saved in R’s custom .rda format. We will see how to do this below. Manual pages go in the man directory. The bad news is that they have to be in a sort-of-LaTeX format that is only a bit less obscure than the runes inscribed on the ancient dagger your colleague brought back from her latest archeological dig. The good news is, we can embed Markdown comments in our source code and use a tool called roxygen2 to extract them and translate them into the format that R packages require. The tests directory holds the package’s unit tests. It should contain files with names like test_some_feature.R, which should in turn contain functions named test_something_specific. We’ll have a closer look at these in Chapter 12. You can type all of this in if you want, but R has a very useful package called usethis that will help you create and maintain packages. To show how it works, we will create an R package called zipffreq (with no dashes or other special characters in its name) to hold word frequencies in classic English novels. The first step is to load usethis in the console with library(usethis) and use usethis::create_package with the path to the new package directory as an argument: usethis::create_package(&#39;~/zipffreq&#39;) ✔ Setting active project to &#39;/Users/hamilton/zipffreq&#39; ✔ Creating &#39;R/&#39; ✔ Creating &#39;man/&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;DESCRIPTION&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;NAMESPACE&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;zipffreq.Rproj&#39; ✔ Adding &#39;.Rproj.user&#39; to &#39;.gitignore&#39; ✔ Adding &#39;^zipffreq\\\\.Rproj$&#39;, &#39;^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39; ✔ Opening new project &#39;zipffreq&#39; in RStudio Every well-behaved package should have a README file, a license, and a Code of Conduct, so we will ask usethis to add those: usethis::use_readme_md() usethis::use_mit_license(name=&quot;Merely Useful&quot;) usethis::use_code_of_conduct() (Note that use_mit_license creates two files: LICENSE and LICENSE.md. The rules for R packages require the former, but GitHub expects the latter.) We then edit README.md to be: # zipffreq An example package for Merely Useful that checks Zipf&#39;s Law for classic English novels. ## Installation TBD ## Example FIXME: add an example. and make a similar edit to DESCRIPTION so that it contains: Package: zipffreq Title: Checks Zipf&#39;s Law for classic English novels. Version: 0.0.0.9000 Authors@R: person(given = &quot;Merely&quot;, family = &quot;Useful&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;), email = &quot;merely.useful@gmail.com&quot;) Description: &gt; Contains data and functions for checking Zipf&#39;s Law for a set of classic English novels. License: MIT + file LICENSE Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true We can now go to the Build tab in RStudio and run Check to see if our empty package makes sense. When we do, the check warns us that there shouldn’t be a period at the end of the package title. Once we fix that, we get a clean bill of health. Leftovers Running Check creates another directory called zipffreq.Rcheck and a file called zipffreq_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz. These are created beside our project directory rather than in it so as not to confuse version control—we don’t want the files we are building committed to our repository. We can now create a placeholder for one of the functions we want to write in a file called R/frequency.R either by using File…New in RStudio or by running usethis::use_r('frequency.R') (which always creates the file in the R directory): word_count &lt;- function(word, text) { 0 } Build…Check runs a lot more checks now because we have some actual code for it to look at. It warns us that our function needs documentation, so we will look at that next. 11.3.1 Exercise: Packaging the CO2 functions Create a brand-new package to hold the CO2 data and functions for analyzing it. Put the license file where R’s packaging rules wants it. Read the documentation for usethis::use_citation and create a citation file. Build the package: what warnings do you get and what do they mean? 11.3.2 Exercise: Exploring a package Clone a GitHub repository that contains an R package, such as https://github.com/r-lib/usethis. Which files in this repository do you recognize, and what are they for? Which files are there to satisfy something other than R’s packaging system? 11.3.3 Exercise: Ignoring Files What does usethis::use_build_ignore do? When would you use it? 11.4 How do I use a package while I’m creating it? The devtools package includes functions to help you create and test packages. After you install it, devtools::load_all(\"path/to/package\") will do the same thing that library(package) does, but use the files you are developing. (If you run load_all() without a path, it will re-load the package in the current working directory, which is what you usually want to do during development.) devtools::load_all is different from devtools::install, which not only installs your package, but also tries to install its dependencies from CRAN. After you use install, the package will be available to other projects on your computer. This is therefore usually one of the last things you do as you come to the end of development. 11.5 How do I document a R package? Our next task is to document our function. To do this, we turn to Hadley Wickham’s R Packages and Karl Broman’s “R package primer” for advice on writing roxygen2. We then return to our source file and put a specially-formatted comment in front of our code: #&#39; Count how often a word appears in a piece of text #&#39; #&#39; @param word the word to search for #&#39; @param text the text to search in #&#39; #&#39; @return number of times the word appears in the text #&#39; #&#39; @export word_count &lt;- function(word, text) { 0 } This comment text, is an example of embedded documentation, can be easily inserted by placing the cursor somewhere in the function and clicking the button “Code -&gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton” in RStudio. Over the years, programmers have found that if they put code in one file and documentation in another, the documentation quickly falls out of date with the code: people will change a function’s name or add a new parameter and forget to update the docs. If the documentation lives right beside the code, on the other hand, the next person to modify the code is far more likely to remember to update it. Tools like roxygen2 can read the code, extract the documentation, and format it as HTML or PDF. They can also do things like create an index, which would be even more painful to do by hand than writing the documentation itself. roxygen2 processes comment lines that start with #' (hash followed by single quote). Putting a comment block right before a function associates that documentation with that function, and @something indicates a roxygen2 command, so what this file is saying is: the function has two parameters called word and text it returns the number of times the word is found in the text; and we want to export it (i.e., we want it to be visible outside the package). These roxygen2 text can also be written with Markdown formatting, so that for instance using **word** will bold the word. Other common formatting includes: [function_name()] or [object_name] to link to other function or object, respectively, documentation in the same package. [pkgname::function_name()] or [pkgname::object_name] to link to function or object, respectively, documentation in another package. [link name](website-link) to link to a website. To enable Markdown with roxygen2 we’ll need to install the package roxygen2md package and use: roxygen2md::roxygen2md(&quot;full&quot;) which will output something like: ✔ Setting active project to &#39;/Users/hamilton/zipffreq&#39; No files changed. ✔ 0 source files changed ℹ Running `devtools::document()` Updating zipffreq documentation Writing NAMESPACE Loading zipffreq Writing NAMESPACE ● Review the changes carefully ● Commit the changes to version control ✔ Setting active project to &#39;&lt;no active project&gt;&#39; This converts all existing documentation to use Markdown version and will also add this line to the DESCRIPTION file: Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) Ok, our function is now documented, but when we run Check, we still get a warning. After a bit more searching and experimentation, we discover that we need to run devtools::document() to regenerate documentation because it isn’t done automatically. When we do this, we get: Updating zipffreq documentation Updating roxygen version in /Users/hamilton/zipffreq/DESCRIPTION Writing NAMESPACE Loading zipffreq Writing NAMESPACE Writing word_count.Rd We now have two files to look at: NAMESPACE and word_count.Rd. The first looks like this: # Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand export(word_count) The comment at the start tells roxygen2 it can overwrite the file, and reminds us that we shouldn’t edit it by hand. The export(word_count) directive is what we really want: as you might guess from the name export, it tells the package builder to make this function visible outside the package. What about word_count.Rd? It lives in the man directory and now contains: % Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand % Please edit documentation in R/frequency.R \\name{word_count} \\alias{word_count} \\title{Count how often a word appears in a piece of text} \\usage{ word_count(word, text) } \\arguments{ \\item{word}{the word to search for} \\item{text}{the text to search in} } \\value{ number of times the word appears in the text } \\description{ Count how often a word appears in a piece of text } Again, there’s a comment at the top to remind us that we shouldn’t edit this by hand. After doing this, we go into “Build…More…Configure build tools” and check “Generate documentation with Roxygen”. Running Check again now gives us a clean bill of health. If we use the Install and Restart button in RStudio’s Build tab, we can now use ?word_count in the console to view our help. 11.5.1 Exercise: Document a function FIXME: write this exercise once the CO2 manipulation functions exist. 11.5.2 Exercise: Use Markdown documentation Read the documentation for the roxygen2md package, which allows you to write R documentation in Markdown, and then convert zipffreq to use Markdown documentation. 11.6 What should I document? The answer to the question in this section’s title depends on what stage of development you are in. If you are doing exploratory programming, a one-line comment to remind yourself of each function’s purpose is good enough. (In fact, it’s probably better than what most people do.) That comment should begin with an active verb and describe how inputs are turned into outputs. If the function has any side effects, you should eliminate them. If you can’t, you should describe them too. An active verb is something like “extract”, “normalize”, or “find”. For example, these are all good one-line comments: “Create a list of current ages from a list of birth dates.” “Ensure training parameters lie in [0..1].” “Reduce the red component of each pixel.” You can tell your one-liners are useful if you can read them aloud in the order the functions are called in place of the function’s name and parameters. Once you start writing code for other people—including yourself three months from now—your documentation should describe: The name and purpose of every function and constant in your code. The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function. Any side effects the function has. The type of value returned by every function. Why and how the function will deliberately fail. If a function uses something like stopifnot or assert to check that a condition holds, then that halt-and-catch-fire behavior is effectively part of its interface. 11.6.1 Exercise: Fixing documentation FIXME: provide poorly-documented function in CO2 package and ask learner to find and fix gaps. 11.6.2 Exercise: Cross-references What should you add to the roxygen2 comments for one function to link to the documentation for another function? Add a cross-reference from the documentation for the function FIXME in the CO2 package to the documentation for the function FIXME. 11.6.3 Exercise: Documenting error conditions The guidelines above said that authors should document why and how their functions will deliberately fail. Where and how should you do this using roxygen2 for R? 11.7 How do I manage package dependencies? In order to understand the rest of what follows, it’s important to understand that R packages are distributed as compiled byte code, not as source code (which is how Python does it) or as binary code (which is how app stores distribute things). When a package is built, R loads and checks the code, then saves the corresponding low-level instructions. Our R files should therefore define functions, not run commands immediately: if they do the latter, those commands will be executed every time the script loads, which is probably not what users will want. As a side effect, this means that if a package uses load(something), then that load command is executed while the package is being compiled, and not while the compiled package is being loaded by a user after distribution (Figure 11.1). If we have loaded the library by hand in our R session during development, though, we might not notice the problem. Figure 11.1: Package Distribution How then can our packages use other packages? The safest way is to use fully-qualified names such as stringr::str_replace every time we call a function from another package or that is defined somewhere outside our package. Let’s modify our word counter to use stringr::str_count: word_count &lt;- function(word, text) { stringr::str_count(text, word) } Since our compiled-and-distributable package will only contain the compiled code for its own functions, direct calls to functions from other packages won’t work after the package is installed. To fix this, we ask usethis to add a note about stringr to DESCRIPTION: usethis::use_package(&#39;stringr&#39;) The bottom of DESCRIPTION now has these two lines: Imports: stringr The Imports field in DESCRIPTION tells R what else it has to install when it installs our package. To be explicit about the version of the package, we can run: usethis::use_tidy_versions() Which will add the version of the package to the DESCRIPTION file, which will look like: Imports: stringr (&gt;= 1.4.0) (See Section 5.7 for a discussion of version numbering.) All right: are we done now? No, we are not: 11.7.1 Exercise: Document dependencies Modify the functions in the CO2 package to use package::function name for everything. Modify the DESCRIPTION file to document the package’s dependencies. 11.7.2 Importing What does @import do in roxygen2 documentation? When should or shouldn’t you use it? 11.8 How can I share my package via GitHub? We said in Section 11.1 that R packages could be shared through GitHub as well as through CRAN. If someone has done this, installing the package on your computer is as simple as: devtools::install_github(&quot;username/reponame&quot;) where username and reponame are the names of the user and the project respectively. If you want to share your work, all you have to do is create a repository whose contents are laid out as described earlier in this chapter: if it looks like an R project, install_github will treat it as one. 11.9 How can I add data to a package? The last steps are to add some cleaned-up data to our package and document the package as a whole. If we want to create fake data or clean up raw data, we should first run the command: # Let&#39;s name the data &quot;small_data&quot;, but it can be anything. usethis::use_data_raw(&quot;small_data&quot;) which outputs: ✔ Creating &#39;data-raw/&#39; ✔ Adding &#39;^data-raw$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;data-raw/small_data.R&#39; ● Modify &#39;data-raw/small_data.R&#39; ● Finish the data preparation script in &#39;data-raw/small_data.R&#39; ● Use `usethis::use_data()` to add prepared data to package that creates the data-raw/ folder and the small_data.R file in that folder. Inside that new file is: ## code to prepare `small_data` dataset goes here usethis::use_data(&quot;small_data&quot;) Let’s replace the first comment with: small_data &lt;- tribble( ~word, ~ count, &quot;some&quot;, 2, &quot;words&quot;, 1, &quot;appear&quot;, 1, &quot;times&quot;, 1) which looks like: # A tibble: 4 x 2 word count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 some 2 2 words 1 3 appear 1 4 times 1 Remove the quotes within the use_data(). The new file should contain the code: small_data &lt;- tribble( ~word, ~ count, &quot;some&quot;, 2, &quot;words&quot;, 1, &quot;appear&quot;, 1, &quot;times&quot;, 1 ) usethis::use_data(small_data) Run the script by hitting “Source” (or source(\"data-raw/small_data.R\")). This will output: ✔ Creating &#39;data/&#39; ✔ Saving &#39;small_data&#39; to &#39;data/small_data.rda&#39; Now the small_data data.frame object is saved to data/ and is now accessible throughout the package! When we run Check, we get a complaint about an undocumented data set, so we create a file called R/small_data.R to hold documentation about the dataset and put this in it: #&#39; Sample word frequency data. #&#39; #&#39; This small dataset contains word frequencies for tutorial purposes. #&#39; #&#39; @docType data #&#39; #&#39; @format A data frame #&#39; \\describe{ #&#39; \\item{word}{The word being counted (chr)} #&#39; \\item{n}{The number of occurrences (int)} #&#39; } &quot;small_data&quot; Everything except the last line is a roxygen2 comment block that describes the data in plain language, then uses some tags and directives to document its format and fields. The line @docType tells roxygen2 that this comment describes data rather than a function, and the last line is the string \"small_data\", i.e., the name of the dataset. We will create one placeholder R file like this for each of our datasets, and each will have that dataset’s name as the thing being documented. Running Check now gives us a different warning: Warning: package needs dependence on R (&gt;= 2.10) We do not fix this by adding another line under Imports in DESCRIPTION, since R itself isn’t a package. Instead, we add this line: Depends: R (&gt;= 2.10) and get a clean bill of health. We use a similar trick to document the package as a whole: we create a file R/zipffreq.R (i.e., a file with exactly the same name as the package) and put this in it: #&#39; Example of an R package. #&#39; #&#39; @author Merely Useful, \\email{merely.useful@gmail.com} #&#39; @docType package #&#39; @name zipffreq NULL That’s right: to document the entire package, we document NULL. One last build, and our package is ready to deliver. The Virtues of Laziness We should always put LazyData: TRUE in DESCRIPTION so that datasets are only loaded on demand. 11.9.1 Exercise: Letting usethis do even more work What does usethis::use_package_doc do? 11.9.2 Exercise: Scripting data creation Put the code two create small_data in an R script in data-raw via usethis::use_data_raw().

A package named mypackage is a directory named mypackage containing a module with a special name __init__.py, which may be empty. Other modules within the directory are visible after the import. A package can contain subpackages. Use virtualenv to create a separate virtual environment for each project. Use pip to create a distributable package containing your project’s software, documentation, and data.

But how can we be sure? The short is answer is that we can’t, but that as in science, we can test our expectations against reality to help us decide if we are sure enough. This chapter explores ways of doing that in R. 12.1 How can I test functions manually? Suppose we have written a function to get the sign of a number. This might be: numSign &lt;- function(x) { if (x &gt; 0) { 1 } else { -1 } } A simple way to test the function interactively is to check that it produces the correct value for a few representative cases: numSign(2) == 1 ## [1] TRUE numSign(0) == 0 ## [1] FALSE numSign(-4) == -1 ## [1] TRUE These tests show that it handles (some) positive and negatives value correctly, but gives the wrong value for zero (whose sign should also be 0). Manual testing is a good place to start, but when we are creating or modifying a larger function, we want to be able to re-run our tests with a single command. That phrase “with a single command” suggests that we should write a second function whose job is to re-run tests for the first. In R, this might be: test_numSign &lt;- function() { stopifnot(numSign(0.1) == 1) stopifnot(numSign(0) == 0) stopifnot(numSign(-Inf) == -1) } As its name suggests, stopifnot stops the program if its argument is not true. 12.2 What features do we want a testing framework to have? The individual tests in test_numSign are called unit tests because they test the smallest units of our code. Writing functions so that we can easily re-run unit tests is a step in the right direction, but our current approach has two flaws. First, if a test fails, none of the tests that come after it run. In this case, for example, we don’t know if numSign handles -Inf correctly or not because testing stops when numSign(0) gives the wrong answer. We would have more information if all of the tests ran every time. The second flaw in test_numSign is that it doesn’t tell us anything if our tests pass. A one-line summary saying “3/3 tests passed” would confirm that the tests actually ran, while something like “2/3 tests passed” followed by a list of the tests that didn’t so we know where to start investigating would be even better. Too Much Information We don’t want our testing framework to list all of the tests that pass because if there is too much output, we will soon start ignoring all of it. A testing framework should only demand that we pay attention to details when we actually need to. One other requirement for a good set of tests is isolation. Suppose that we have two functions first and second and we test them in this way: first_result = first() check(first_result) second_result = second(first_result) check(second_result) If first produces a wrong answer, we won’t know if second is working because we won’t know what its actual input is. Using the output of one test as the input of another increases the risk of false positives (tests passing when they should fail) and false negatives (tests failing when they should pass), which distract or mislead us. Putting these requirements together, a single unit test has: a function being tested (e.g., the number 0 or a list of images); an actual result, which is what the code produces when given that fixture; and an expected result that the actual result is compared to. Each test can have one of three results: success: the code passed the test. failure: the code didn’t pass the test. error: something went wrong with the test itself, so we don’t know anything for certain about the code being tested. A test framework (also called a test runner) should: find and run tests; summarize results; pinpoint the locations of failures so that users know where to start debugging; encourage people to isolate tests; and make it easy to write and update tests (because otherwise people won’t do it). The next two sections will introduce the most popular frameworks for R. We will then explore general issues such as how we can tell which parts of our code have and haven’t been tested and what kinds of tests we should write. 12.3 Create and run unit tests The easiest way to start testing in R is via the usethis package. Let’s create a new project in RStudio called creater of type “package” (both because usethis is designed to work with packages, and because our R projects should always be packages). We can then type: usethis::use_testthat() ✔ Setting active project to &#39;/Users/merely/creater&#39; ✔ Adding &#39;testthat&#39; to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION ✔ Creating &#39;tests/testthat/&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;tests/testthat.R&#39; ● Call `use_test()` to initialize a basic test file and open it for editing. The call creates a new directory tests/testthat/, adds testthat to Suggests in the DESCRIPTION file, and creates a file called tests/testthat.R that tells R how to run the tests. This may seem like a lot, but it is all needed to create an R package (Chapter 11), so we might as well do things that way from the start. The file tests/testthat.R contains: library(testthat) library(creater) test_check(&quot;creater&quot;) I.e., it loads the testthat library and our own package, then calls test_check to run tests. If we try to run our tests using: devtools::test() we get the message: No tests: no files in /Users/merely/creater/tests/testthat match &#39;^test.*\\.[rR]$&#39; This is fair, since we haven’t yet created any tests. To do that, we run: usethis::use_test(&quot;mean&quot;) ✔ Increasing &#39;testthat&#39; version to &#39;&gt;= 2.1.0&#39; in DESCRIPTION ✔ Writing &#39;tests/testthat/test-mean.R&#39; ● Modify &#39;tests/testthat/test-mean.R&#39; As the output suggests, this command creates a file called tests/testthat/test-mean.R. We could create this file ourselves if we want; either way, its name should reflect what we are using it to test, such as test-read-data.R or test-annual-analysis.R. Note that we do not type the prefix test- in the call to usethis::use_test; usethis will insert that automatically. The newly-created file contains a single test case: test_that(&quot;multiplication works&quot;, { expect_equal(2 * 2, 4) }) We can run this with: devtools::test() Loading creater Testing creater ✔ | OK F W S | Context ✔ | 1 | mean ══ Results ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ OK: 1 Failed: 0 Warnings: 0 Skipped: 0 or use the RStudio keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+T (on Windows) or Cmd+Shift+T (on Mac), which calls the same function. Either way, R searches below the tests/testthat directory to find files whose names start with test, loads them, and runs the tests that it finds. The output tells us that one test passed, none failed, there were no warnings, and no tests were skipped. Let’s re-open tests/testthat/test-mean.R and replace the test that R wrote for us with this code: context(&quot;Computing the mean&quot;) test_that(&quot;the mean of an odd-length vector is correct&quot;, { expect_identical(mean(1:3), 2.0) }) test_that(&quot;the mean of an even-length vector is correct&quot;, { expect_identical(mean(1:4), 2.0) }) Loading creater Testing creater ✔ | OK F W S | Context ✖ | 1 1 | Computing the mean ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── test-mean.R:8: failure: the mean of an even-length vector is correct mean(1:4) not identical to 2. 1/1 mismatches [1] 2.5 - 2 == 0.5 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ══ Results ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ OK: 1 Failed: 1 Warnings: 0 Skipped: 0 The little table at the top of the output shows that one test passed and one failed in the context titled \"Computing the mean\". The lines below tell us what failed and why, and the final section of the report summarizes the results. It is redundant in this case, since both of our tests are in the same context, but is useful if we have several files full of tests. 12.4 How should I set up my unit tests? TODO: This section is about fixtures. I’m not aware of “fixtures” in R, so this will need to be modified. Test files all have a similar structure: Load the software to be tested (since it normally won’t be in the same file as the tests). Write one short function to test each feature of the software. Each test function also has a stereotypical structure: Create the test file. Run the test. Check the result. Creating a test file often requires many lines of code, so we often write helper functions to do this. For example, if we are testing functions that work on multiple dataframes in R, we might write a function like this: create_three_frames &lt;- function() { ones &lt;- tribble( ~odd, ~even, 1, 2, 3, 4) tens &lt;- tribble( ~odd, ~even, 10, 20, 30, 40) hundreds &lt;- tribble( ~odd, ~even, 100, 200, 300, 400) list(ones=ones, tens=tens, hundreds=hundreds) } We could then use the helper (?) that function produces in many tests. Here, for example, we are using it to test a function called columnize: test_that(&quot;columnize combines columns by name with addition&quot;, { fixture &lt;- create_three_frames() result &lt;- columnize(fixture, &#39;+&#39;, odd) expect_equal(result$odd, c(111, 333)) }) test_that(&quot;columnize combines columns by name with multiplication&quot;, { fixture &lt;- create_three_frames() result &lt;- columnize(fixture, &#39;*&#39;, odd) expect_equal(result$odd, c(1000, 9000)) }) Using helper functions to create fixtures like this reduces the cognitive load on whoever has to maintain the tests, since they only have to form a mental model of a few cases rather than a new one for each test. Note that we do not create the fixture once as a global variable and then re-use it in many tests. Tests should be isolated, and having them share data increases the chances that one of our tests will modify the data in ways that interfere with other tests. 12.5 How should I check the results of tests? Once we have a result we need to check it. Testing in the Real World In practice, most programmers would write combined_tests in this case rather than doubling the amount of reading they have to do in order to understand these tests. The purpose of testing is always to draw attention to things that need it; if the second check in combined_tests doesn’t run because the first one failed then we will have less information than we could, but we will still know the most important thing: our code is broken. R’s testthat library provides multiple checking functions for different purposes. expect_identical() compares that actual and expected results are identical down to the last bit. expect_equal() checks that its arguments are equal within a narrow tolerance; as we discuss in Section ??, this is more useful for most data science problems. Others include expect_length, which checks that a vector has the right length, and expect_match, which checks that a string matches a regular expression. We can always replace these with expect_true, i.e., use: expect_true(length(result == 3)) instead of: expect_length(result, 3) but the latter makes our intention clearer. 12.6 Why and how should I test that software fails correctly? Evil clowns are every programmer’s worst nightmare. Their second worst is a silent failure: something that goes wrong but doesn’t crash, print a warning, or otherwise signal that human attention is required. Testing that our code fails when it should is therefore just as important as testing that it runs correctly. We Have the Data The need to test error handling is not just folklore: in their study of failures in data-intensive applications, Yuan et al. (2014) found that, “the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code—the last line of defense—even without an understanding of the software design.” testthat provides specific functions to test for errors or warnings called expect_error() and expect_warning() respectively: test_that(&quot;text must not be empty&quot;, { expect_error(count_words(&quot;&quot;)) }) 12.7 How can I tell whether my code has been tested or not? As we write more code or make changes to code we already have, we may lose track of which parts we have tested and which we haven’t. Even short programs, loops or conditionals may make it difficult for us to figure out what is actually being executed. For example, take a few moments to read this function in R first &lt;- function(left, right) { if (left &lt; right) { tmp &lt;- left left &lt;- right right &lt;- tmp } while (left &gt; right) { value &lt;- second(left, right) left &lt;- right right &lt;- as.integer(right / 2) } value } second &lt;- function(check, balance) { if (check &gt; 0) { balance } else { 0 } } c(3, 5, first(3, 5)) The only way to know which parts of these functions are and aren’t executed is to trace their execution a line at a time. The good news is that we don’t have to do this ourselves: a code coverage tool will do this for us. In essence, a code coverage tool creates a vector of Boolean flags with one entry for each line of code, then modifies the code so that the appropriate flag is set to true whenever that line is executed (Figure 12.1). When the program finishes, the tool can show us which lines were touched and report summary statistics such as the number or percentage of lines that weren’t used. Figure 12.1: How Coverage Works The covr package has several functions for checking coverage. For example, we can test the coverage of the tests for a package by running: covr::package_coverage() This function outputs a list of all R files in the package with their corresponding percentage coverage, which is a good way to figure out what needs to be done next. 12.8 How much testing is enough? If we are writing software for a safety-critical application such as a medical device, we should aim for 100% code coverage, i.e., every single line in the application should be tested. In fact, we should probably go further and aim for 100% path coverage and ensure that every possible path through the code has been checked. But most of us don’t write software that people’s lives depend on, so requiring 100% code coverage is like asking for ten decimal places of accuracy when checking the voltage of a household electrical outlet. We always need to balance the effort required to create tests against the likelihood that those tests will uncover useful information. It’s important to understand that no amount of testing can prove a piece of software is completely correct. A function with only two numeric arguments has 2128 possible inputs. Even if we could write the tests, how could we be sure we were checking the result of each one correctly? And testing data analysis pipelines is often harder than testing mainstream software applications, since data analysts often don’t know what the right answer is. (If we did, we would have submitted our report and moved on to the next problem already.) The key distinction is the difference between validation, which asks whether the specification is correct, while verification, which asks whether we have met that specification. The difference between them is the difference between building the right thing and building something right, and the former question is often hard for data scientists to answer. Luckily, we can group the test cases for most functions into classes. For example, it might be possible to test a function that takes numbers as inputs as well as we need to using only a few cases: zero, a positive number, a negative one, and infinity. If we want to go further, we could check that it fails the right way when given a string or a list. Similarly, when testing a function that summarizes a table full of data, we should probably check that it handles tables with: no rows only one row many identical rows rows having keys that are supposed to be unique, but aren’t rows that contain nothing but missing values Some projects develop checklists to remind programmers what they ought to test. These checklists can be a bit daunting for newcomers, but they are a great way to pass on hard-earned experience. 12.9 When should I write my tests? Many programmers are passionate advocates of a practice called test-driven development (TDD). Rather than writing code and then writing tests, they write the tests first and then write just enough code to make those tests pass. Once the code is working, they clean it up (Chapter ??) and then move on to the next task. TDD’s advocates claim that working this way leads to better code in less time because: Writing tests clarifies what the code is actually supposed to do. It eliminates confirmation bias. If someone has just written a function, they are predisposed to want it to be right, so they will bias their tests towards proving that it is correct instead of trying to uncover errors. Writing tests first ensures that they actually get written. These arguments are plausible. However, studies such as Fucci et al. (2016) don’t support them: in practice, writing tests first or last doesn’t appear to affect productivity. What does have an impact is working in small, interleaved increments, i.e., writing just a few lines of code and testing it before moving on rather than writing several pages of code and then spending hours on testing. So how do most data scientists figure out if their software is doing the right thing? The answer is spot checks: each time they produce an intermediate or final result, they scan a table, create a chart, or inspect some summary statistics to see if everything looks OK. Their heuristics are usually easy to state, like “there shouldn’t be NAs at this point” or “the age range should be reasonable”, but applying those heuristics to a particular analysis always depends on their evolving insight into the data in question. By analogy with test-driven development, we could call this process checking-driven development (CDD). Each time we add a step to our pipeline and look at its output, we can also add a check of some kind to the pipeline to ensure that what we are checking for remains true as the pipeline evolves or is run on other data. This helps reusability—it’s amazing how often a one-off analysis winds up being used many times—but the real goal is comprehensibility. If someone can get our code and data, run the former on the latter, and get the same result that we did, then our computation is reproducible, but that doesn’t mean they can understand it. Comments help (either in the code or as blocks of prose in a computational notebook), but they won’t check that assumptions and invariants hold. And unlike comments, runnable assertions can’t fall out of step with what the code is actually doing… We also need to distinguish between testing during development and testing in production. During development, our main concern is whether our answers are (close enough to) what we expect. We do this by analyzing small datasets and convincing ourselves that we’re getting the right answer in some ad hoc way. In production, on the other hand, our goal is to detect cases where behavior deviates significantly from what we previously decided what right. We want this to be automated so that our pipeline will ring an alarm bell to tell us something is wrong even if we’re busy working on something else. This can happen because real data will never have exactly the same characteristics as the data we used during development. We also need these checks because the pipeline’s environment can change: for example, someone could upgrade a library that one of our libraries depends on, which could lead to us getting slightly different answers than we expected. 12.10 How should I write tests that involved floating-point values? The absolute spacing between the values we can represent in Figure ?? is uneven. However, the relative spacing between each set of values stays the same: the first group is separated by 1, then the separation becomes 2, then 4, and then 8. This happens because we’re multiplying the same fixed set of mantissas by ever-larger exponents, and it leads to some useful definitions. The absolute error in an approximation is the absolute value of the difference between the approximation and the actual value. The relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the value we’re approximating. For example, it we are off by 1 in approximating 8+1 and 56+1, we have the same absolute error, but the relative error is larger in the first case than in the second. Relative error is almost always more important than absolute error when we are testing software because it makes little sense to say that we’re off by a hundredth when the value in question is a billionth. Accuracy is how close our answer is to right, and precision is how close repeated measurements are to each other. We can be precise without being accurate (systematic bias), or accurate without being precise (near the right answer but without many significant digits). Accuracy is usually more important than precision for human decision making: a relative error of 10-2 (two decimal places) is good enough for most data science because the decision a human being would make won’t change if the number changes by 1%. We now come to the crux of this lesson: if the function we are testing uses floating point numbers, what should we compare its result to? If we compared the sum of the first few numbers in vals to the “right” answer, the answer could be False even though we’re doing nothing wrong. If we compared it to a previously calculated result that we had stored somehow, the match would be exact. No one has a good generic answer to this problem because its root cause is that we’re using approximations, and each approximation has to be judged in context. So what can you do to test your programs? If you are comparing to a saved result, and the result was saved at full precision, you could use exact equality, because there is no reason for the new number to differ. However, any change to your code, however small, could trigger a report of a difference. Experience shows that these spurious warnings quickly lead developers to stop paying attention to their tests. A much better approach is to write a test that checks whether numbers are the same within some tolerance, which is best expressed as a relative error. R’s expect_equal does this automatically. 12.11 How can I test plots and other graphical results? Testing visualizations is hard: any change to the dimension of the plot, however small, can change many pixels in a raster image, and cosmetic changes such as moving the legend up a couple of pixels will similarly cause false positives. The simplest solution is therefore to test the data used to produce the image rather than the image itself. Unless we suspect that the plotting library contains bugs, the correct data should alwyas produce the correct plot. If we do need to test the generated image, the only practical approach is to compare it to a saved image that we have visually verified. As with choosing tolerances for floating-point tests, our rule for picking thresholds should be, “If images are close enough that a human being would make the same decision about meaning, the test should pass” Another approach is to save the plot in a vector format like SVG that stores the coordinates of lines and other elements as text. We can then check that the right elements are there with the right properties. However, this is usually unrewarding: again, small changes to the library or to plotting parameters can make all of the tests fail by moving elements by a pixel or two. Vector-based tests therefore still need to have thresholds on floating-point values. TODO: Include R example/package for this. 12.12 What data should I use to test my analyses? There aren’t any useful general rules for testing the calculations that our pipelines do, since those calculations vary from one pipeline to the next, but there are some rules about where to get data to test with. The first method is subsampling: choose random subsets of your data, analyze it, and see how close the output is to what you get with the full dataset. If the output doesn’t converge as the sample size grows, something is probably unstable in either the algorithm or its implementation. When we are subsampling, it’s vital that we select a truly random subset of data rather than (for example) the first N records or every N’th record. If there is any ordering or grouping in our data, those techniques can produce samples that are biased, which may in turn invalidate some of your tests. The other approach is to test with synthetic data. A few lines of code can generate uniform data (i.e., data having the same values for all observations), strongly bimodal data (which is handy for testing clustering algorithms), or a pseudorandom sample with a known distribution. If we do this, we should also give our pipeline data that doesn’t fit your expected distribution and make sure that something, somewhere, complains. Doing this is the data science equivalent of testing the fire alarm every once in a while. For example, we can write a short program to generate data that conforms to Zips’ Law and use it to test our analysis. Real data will be integers, since words only occur or not, and distributions will be fractional. After a bit of experimentation, we will use 5% relative error as our threshold for correctness: 1% excludes a valid correct case. 12.13 How can I test a program that uses random numbers? FIXME: explain how to test in the presence of random values 12.14 How can I test a data analysis pipeline in production? An operational test is one that is kept in place during production to tell users if everything is still working as it should. Some common operational tests include: Does this pipeline stage produce the same number of output records as input records? Or fewer if the stage is aggregating? If two or more tables are being joined, is the number of output records equal to the product of the number of input records? Is the standard deviation smaller than the range of the data? Are there any NaNs or NULLs where there aren’t supposed to be? A common pattern for such tests is to have every tool append information to a log file and then have another tool check that log file after the run is over. Logging while calculating and checking afterward makes it easy to compare values between pipeline stages, and ensures that there’s a record of why a problem was reported. Validating Pipelines There are several libraries for validating data pipelines in R, including assertr, checkr, and validate. 12.15 How can I infer and check properties of my data? Writing tests for the properties of data can be tedious, but some of the work can be automated. 12.16 Summary Figure 12.2: Correctness Concept Map 12.17 Exercises 12.17.1 Fixing numSign Fix the implementation of numSign in either R so that all tests will succeed. Re-run the tests to confirm that the function is working. Extend the function so that it does something sensible when passed a string or an empty list. Write functions to check your changes. 12.17.2 Checking simple calculations Create a new test by running usethis::use_test(\"simple-arithmetic\"). Copy the code below into the newly created test file and fill in the blanks so that it runs correctly. context(&quot;Check simple calculations&quot;) test_that(&quot;plus and minus give correct outputs&quot;, { expect_identical(1 + 2, 3) ___(1 - 2, -1) expect_identical(1 + NA, __) expect_identical(___ - ___, NA) }) 12.17.3 Explain the purpose of tests Based on the contents of the tests below, replace the blanks with appropriate context() and test_that() messages. context(&quot;___&quot;) test_that(&quot;___&quot;, { expect_identical(sum(c(1, 2)), 3) expect_identical(sum(c(NA, 2)), NA) }) test_that(&quot;___&quot;, { expect_identical(mean(c(1, 2)), 1.5) expect_identical(mean(c(NA, 2)), NA) }) 12.17.4 Testing count_words Create a new test file. Write unit tests for count_words to check the following: Returns zero when given an empty string. Returns NA when given NA. Returns 2 when given two words separated by a space. Returns 2 when given two words separated by a dash -. 12.17.5 Checking for errors Add new unit tests for the word-counting function to check that it raises errors when it should. 12.18 Key Points The purpose of testing is to convince people (including yourself) that software is correct enough and to make tolerances on ‘enough’ explicit. Add assertions to your code so that it checks itself as it runs. Write unit tests to check small “units” or pieces of your code.

This lesson therefore looks at what should be included in or alongside reports and how best to do that. As before, we use the generic term “report” to include research papers, summaries for clients, and everything else that is shorter than a book and aimed at people other than its creators or contributors. Modern publishing involves much more than simply producing a report. It involves providing readers with the data underpinning the report, as well as any code written in analysing the data: An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures. — Jonathan Buckheit and David Donoho, paraphrasing Jon Claerbout, in Buckheit and Donoho (1995) As the quote suggests, modern publishing involves much more than simply producing a report. It involves providing readers with the data underpinning the report, as well as any code written in analysing the data. These days, the “complete set of instructions” is primarily software, which may range from scripts or notebooks written solely for the purpose of the report to packages that are developed and released for use by a wider audience. While some reports, datasets, software packages and/or analysis scripts can’t be published without violating personal or commercial confidentiality, every researcher’s default should be to make all these components of their work as widely available as possible. That means publishing it under an open license (Section ??) so that people who aren’t in academia can find and access it. What Is Metadata? FIXME: explain what metadata is and why people should care. 13.1 How are reports and authors identified? Before publishing anything, we need to understand the systems used to identify works and their authors. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique identifier for a particular version of a particular digital artifact such as a report, a dataset, or a piece of software. DOIs are written as doi:prefix/suffix, but are often also represented as URLs like http://dx.doi.org/prefix/suffix. In order to be allowed to issue a DOI (i.e., to become a prefix), academic journals, data archives, and others must guarantee a certain level of security, longevity and access. An ORCID is an Open Researcher and Contributor ID. You can get an ORCID for free, and you should include it in publications because people’s names and affiliations change over time. 13.2 Where should I publish my reports? The best option for publishing a report depends on the context. Numerous open access journals support academic, peer-reviewed research papers, and many formerly closed-access journals also now offer an open access option, though sometimes for an additional fee. Another option is to publish with an online pre-print server such as arXiv (which started it all) or bioRxiv. A preprint is a version of an academic research paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal. Online writing platforms such as Authorea and Overleaf are also an option. These allow a report to be openly viewable on the web throughout the entire writing process. Once work is complete (or as complete as research writing ever is), they can issue a DOI or the text can be exported for submission to an academic journal. For everything other than reports, online platforms such as Figshare and Zenodo can issue DOIs as well. It is common for people to upload datasets and other items to these platforms so that they can be easily accessed by others. 13.3 How should I publish data? The first step in publishing the data associated with a report is to determine what (if anything) needs to be published. If the report involved the analysis of a publicly available dataset that is maintained and documented by a third party (e.g. open government data), then it’s likely that no data publishing is required. The report simply needs to document where to access the data and what version was analyzed, along with any scripts and software used to download and process the data. In other words, it’s not necessary to re-publish a duplicate of the original dataset if it’s already accessible elsewhere. It’s not strictly necessary to publish data files produced during the analysis of a publicly available dataset either, since readers have access to the original data and the scripts/software used to process it. However, it can be advantageous to publish processed data that is difficult to reproduce (e.g., might require access to a supercomputing facility to run the code) and/or represents a derived quantity with high re-use potential. For example, it would be worthwhile to publish an estimate of the global average surface temperature derived from a large database of weather observations, because a simple metric of global warming could be useful in many subsequent studies. If a report involves a new dataset, such as observations collected during a field experiment, then the simple version of how to publish it is: Always use tidy data. Include keywords describing the data in the project’s README.md so that they appear on its home page and can easily be found by search engines. Give every dataset and every report a unique identifier (Section 13.1). Put data in open repositories. Use well-known formats like CSV and HDF5. Include an explicit license in every project and every dataset. Include units and other metadata. The last point is often the hardest for people to implement, since many researchers have never seen a well-documented dataset. We draw inspiration from the data catalog included in the repository for Diehm and Thomas and include a file ./data/README.md in every project that looks like this: - Infants born to women with HIV receiving an HIV test within two months of birth, 2009-2017 - `Infant_HIV_Testing_2017.xlsx` - What is this?: Excel spreadsheet with summarized data. - Source(s): UNICEF, &lt;https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/hiv-aids-statistical-tables/&gt; - Last Modified: July 2018 (according to website) - Contact: Greg Wilson &lt;greg.wilson@rstudio.com&gt; - Spatial Applicability: global - Temporal Applicability: 2009-2017 - `infant_hiv.csv` - What is this?: CSV export from `Infant_HIV_Testing_2017.xlsx` - Notes - Data is not tidy: some rows are descriptive comments, others are blank separators between sections, and column headers are inconsistent. - Use `tidy_infant_hiv()` to tidy this data. - Maternal health indicators disaggregated by age - `maternal_health_adolescents_indicators_April-2016_250d599.xlsx` - What is this?: Excel spreadsheet with summarized data. - Source(s): UNICEF, &lt;https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/maternal-health-data/&gt; - Last Modified: July 2018 (according to website) - Contact: Greg Wilson &lt;greg.wilson@rstudio.com&gt; - Spatial Applicability: global - Temporal Applicability: 2000-2014 - `at_health_facilities.csv` - What is this?: percentage of births at health facilities by country, year, and mother&#39;s age - Source(s): single sheet from `maternal_health_adolescents_indicators_April-2016_250d599.xlsx` - `c_sections.csv` - What is this?: percentage of Caesarean sections by country, year, and mother&#39;s age - Source(s): single sheet from `maternal_health_adolescents_indicators_April-2016_250d599.xlsx` - `skilled_attendant_at_birth.csv` - What is this?: percentage of births with skilled attendant present by country, year, and mother&#39;s age - Source(s): single sheet from `maternal_health_adolescents_indicators_April-2016_250d599.xlsx` - Notes - Data is not tidy: some rows are descriptive comments, others are blank separators between sections, and column headers are inconsistent. - Use `tidy_maternal_health_adolescents()` to tidy this data. The catalog above doesn’t include column headers or units because the data isn’t tidy. It does include the names of the functions used to reformat that data, and ./results/README.md then includes the information that users will want. One section of that file is shown below: - Infants born to women with HIV receiving an HIV test within two months of birth, 2009-2017 - infant_hiv.csv - What is this?: tidied version of CSV export from spreadsheet. - Source(s): UNICEF, &lt;https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/hiv-aids-statistical-tables/&gt; - Last Modified: September 2018 - Contact: Greg Wilson &lt;greg.wilson@rstudio.com&gt; - Spatial Applicability: global - Temporal Applicability: 2009-2017 - Generated By: scripts/tidy-24.R | Header | Datatype | NA | Description | |----------|----------|-------|---------------------------------------------| | country | char | false | ISO3 country code of country reporting data | | year | integer | false | year CE for which data reported | | estimate | double | true | estimated percentage of measurement | | hi | double | true | high end of range | | lo | double | true | low end of range | Note that this catalog includes both units and whether or not a field can be NA. Note also that calling a field “NA” is asking for trouble… 13.4 What standards of data sharing should I aspire to? The FAIR Principles describe what research data should look like. They are still aspirational for most researchers (Brock), but they tell us what to aim for. The most immediately important elements of the FAIR Principles are outlined below. 13.4.1 Data should be findable. The first step in using or re-using data is to find it. You can tell you’ve done this if: (Meta)data is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier (Section 13.1). Data is described with rich metadata (like the catalog shown above). Metadata clearly and explicitly includes the identifier of the data it describes. (Meta)data is registered or indexed in a searchable resource, such as the data sharing platforms described in Section 13.3. 13.4.2 Data should be accessible. You can’t use data if you don’t have access to it. In practice, this rule means the data should be openly accessible (the preferred solution) or that authenticating in order to view or download it should be free. You can tell you’ve done this if: (Meta)data is retrievable by its identifier using a standard communications protocol like HTTP. Metadata is accessible even when the data is no longer available. 13.4.3 Data should be interoperable. Data usually needs to be integrated with other data, which means that tools need to be able to process it. You can tell you’ve done this if: (Meta)data uses a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation (Meta)data uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles (Meta)data includes qualified references to other (meta)data 13.4.4 Data should be reusable. This is the ultimate purpose of the FAIR Principles and much other work. You can tell you’ve done this if: Meta(data) is described with accurate and relevant attributes. (Meta)data is released with a clear and accessible data usage license. (Meta)data has detailed provenance. (Meta)data meets domain-relevant community standards. 13.4.5 How and where do I publish the data? Small datasets (i.e., anything under 500 MB) can be stored in version control using the conventions described in Chapter 9. If the data is being used in several projects, it may make sense to create one repository to hold only the data; the R community refers to these as data packages, and they are often accompanied by small scripts to clean up and query the data. Be sure to give the dataset an identifier as discussed in Section 13.1. For medium-sized datasets (between 500 MB and 5 GB), it’s better to put the data on platforms like the Open Science Framework, Dryad, and Figshare. Each of these will give the datasets identifiers; those identifiers should be included in reports along with scripts to download the data. Big datasets (i.e., anything more than 5 GB) may not be yours in the first place, and probably need the attention of a professional archivist. Any processed or intermediate data that takes a long time to regenerate should probably be published as well using these same sizing rules; all of this data should be given identifiers, and those identifiers should be included in reports. Data Journals While archiving data at a site like Dryad or Figshare (following the FAIR Principles) is usually the end of the data publishing process, there is the option of publishing a journal paper to describe the dataset in detail. Some research disciplines have journals devoted to describing particular types of data (e.g., the Geoscience Data Journal) and there are also generic data journals (e.g., Scientific Data). 13.5 How should I publish my software packages? Chapter 11 shows how to document and package software. The final step in this process is publication. It is common practice to have the code associated with a software package openly available on a hosting service such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These hosting services are not only a convenient place for people to ask questions and make contributions/improvements to the software, they also have built-in functionality for managing the release of new versions of the software. One limitation of these sites, however, is that they don’t guarantee persistent long term storage (e.g., if you changed the name of your GitHub repository any URLs for the existing repository would be broken). Acknowledging this limitation, GitHub provides Zenodo integration for creating a DOI with each new software release. TODO: Add explanation about CRAN. Software Journals While creating a DOI using a site like Zenodo is often the end of the software publishing process, there is the option of publishing a journal paper to describe the software in detail. Some research disciplines have journals devoted to describing particular types of software (e.g., Geoscientific Model Development), and there are also a number of generic software journals such as the Journal of Open Research Software and the Journal of Open Source Software. 13.6 How should I publish my other software? The final component that needs to be published is the analysis scripts. Unlike analysis software that has been packaged and released for use by a wider audience, analysis scripts are simply written to create the figures and tables presented in a given report. These scripts typically make use of packages written by the wider community (such as matplotlib and ggplot) as well discipline-specific packages written by colleagues or co-authors. Given that analysis scripts will typically leverage a wide variety of existing software packages, three separate items need to be published: A detailed description of the analysis software used A copy of any analysis scripts written by the authors to produce the key results presented in the report A description of the data processing steps taken in producing each key result (i.e. a step-by-step account of how the software and scripts were actually implemented) Earlier we saw that there are well-developed and widely adopted guidelines for data publishing (e.g., the FAIR Principles). The same is not true for analysis scripts. Librarians, publishers, and regulatory bodies are still trying to determine the best way for code to be documented and archived. For the moment, the best advice we can give for those three key items is discussed below. That advice ranges from the bare minimum that needs to be done through to current gold standard practice. 13.6.1 Software description In order to document the software packages that were used, the bare minimum requirement is to list the name and version number of each software package that played a critical role in producing the analysis presented in your report. While such a list means your software environment is now technically reproducible, you’ve left it up to the reader to figure out how to get all those software packages and libraries installed and playing together nicely. In some cases it might be easy enough for a reader to install the handful of R packages you used, but in other cases you might want to save the reader (and your future self) the pain of software installation by making use of a tool that can automatically install a specified software environment. Complex tools like Docker can literally install your entire environment (down to the precise operating system) on a different computer. There’s lots of debate about the potential and suitability of these tools as a solution to reproducible research, but their complexity puts them out of reach for many researchers. 13.6.2 Analysis scripts The next item you’ll need to publish is a copy of the scripts written to execute those software packages. Depending on the size or complexity of the scripts you have written, and whether you re-use them in multiple projects, you may publish script by script or create a zip file or tar file that includes everything. 13.6.3 Data processing steps A software description and analysis scripts on their own are not much use to a reader; they also need to know how those scripts was actually executed. This means including the configuration files (Chapter ??), and/or command-line parameters used to generate each key result. The way in which this information is collected and archived depends on how your workflow is constructed. If all of a program’s parameters are in a configuration file (Chapter ??), then that file can be archived. Alternatively, you might need to have your program print out its configuration parameters and then use grep or a script to extract information from the logfile (Chapter ??). If your workflow involves executing a series of command line programs, then you can keep a log/record of the command line entries required to produce a given result. As before, while these bare minimum log files ensure that your workflow is reproducible, they may not be particularly comprehensible. Manually recreating workflows from them might be a tedious and time consuming process, even for just moderately complex analyses. To make things a little easier for the reader (and your future self), it’s a good idea to include a README file in your code library explaining the sequence of commands required to produce common/key results. You might also provide a Makefile that automatically builds and executes common workflows. 13.7 Summary FIXME: create concept map for publishing 13.8 Exercises 13.8.1 ORCID If you don’t already have an ORCID, go to the website and register now. If you do have an ORCID, log in and make sure that your details and publication record are up-to-date. 13.8.2 A FAIR test An online questionnaire for measuring the extent to which datasets are FAIR has been created by the Australian Research Data Commons. Take the questionnaire for a dataset you have published or that you use often. 13.8.3 Publishing your code Think about a project that you’re currently working on. How would you go about publishing the code associated with that project (i.e., the software description, analysis scripts, and data processing steps)? 13.9 Key Points Include small datasets in repositories; store large ones on data sharing sites, and include metadata in the repository to locate them. An ORCID is a unique personal identifier that you can use to identify your work. A DOI is a unique identifier for a particular dataset, report, or software release. Data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Use Zenodo to obtain DOIs. Publish your software as you would a paper.

Yes: goes up one level. F.1.4 Exercise 2.15.4 No: there is a directory backup in /Users. No: this is the content of Users/thing/backup, but with .. we asked for one level further up. No: see previous explanation. Yes: ../backup/ refers to /Users/backup/. F.1.5 Exercise 2.15.5 No: pwd is not the name of a directory. Yes: ls without directory argument lists files and directories in the current directory. Yes: uses the absolute path explicitly. F.1.6 Exercise 2.15.6 The touch command generates a new file called my_file.txt in your current directory. You can observe this newly generated file by typing ls at the command line prompt. my_file.txt can also be viewed in your GUI file explorer. When you inspect the file with ls -l, note that the size of my_file.txt is 0 bytes. In other words, it contains no data. If you open my_file.txt using your text editor it is blank. Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but instead require that empty files have already been generated. When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to populate with its output. The touch command allows you to efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such programs. F.1.7 Exercise 2.15.7 $ mv ../analyzed/sucrose.dat ../analyzed/maltose.dat . Recall that .. refers to the parent directory (i.e. one above the current directory) and that . refers to the current directory. F.1.8 Exercise 2.15.8 No. While this would create a file with the correct name, the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory and would need to be deleted. Yes, this would work to rename the file. No, the period(.) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names cannot be created. No, the period(.) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names cannot be created. F.1.9 Exercise 2.15.9 We start in the /Users/jamie/data directory, and create a new folder called recombine. The second line moves (mv) the file proteins.dat to the new folder (recombine). The third line makes a copy of the file we just moved. The tricky part here is where the file was copied to. Recall that .. means “go up a level”, so the copied file is now in /Users/jamie. Notice that .. is interpreted with respect to the current working directory, not with respect to the location of the file being copied. So, the only thing that will show using ls (in /Users/jamie/data) is the recombine folder. No, see explanation above. proteins-saved.dat is located at /Users/jamie Yes No, see explanation above. proteins.dat is located at /Users/jamie/data/recombine No, see explanation above. proteins-saved.dat is located at /Users/jamie F.1.10 Exercise 2.15.10 $ rm: remove regular file &#39;thesis_backup/quotations.txt&#39;? y The -i option will prompt before (every) removal (use Y to confirm deletion or N to keep the file). The Unix shell doesn’t have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever. By using the -i option, we have the chance to check that we are deleting only the files that we want to remove. F.1.11 Exercise 2.15.11 If given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must be the last argument), cp copies the files to the named directory. If given three file names, cp throws an error such as the one below, because it is expecting a directory name as the last argument. cp: target ‘morse.txt’ is not a directory F.1.12 Exercise 2.15.12 The solution is 3. 1. shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (*) followed by the letter t, then zero or more characters (*) followed by ane.pdb. This gives ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb. 2. shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (*) followed by the letter t, then a single character (?), then ne. followed by zero or more characters (*). This will give us octane.pdb and pentane.pdb but doesn’t match anything which ends in thane.pdb. 3. fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (??) between t and ne. This is the solution. 4. only shows files starting with ethane.. F.1.13 Exercise 2.15.13 $ cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration $ cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/ $ cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/ F.1.14 Exercise 2.15.14 mv *.dat analyzed Jamie needs to move her files fructose.dat and sucrose.dat to the analyzed directory. The shell will expand *.dat to match all .dat files in the current directory. The mv command then moves the list of .dat files to the “analyzed” directory. F.1.15 Exercise 2.15.15 The first two sets of commands achieve this objective. The first set uses relative paths to create the top level directory before the subdirectories. The third set of commands will give an error because mkdir won’t create a subdirectory of a non-existant directory: the intermediate level folders must be created first. The final set of commands generates the ‘raw’ and ‘processed’ directories at the same level as the ‘data’ directory. F.1.16 Exercise 2.15.16 The -n option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort. F.1.17 Exercise 2.15.17 In the first example with &gt;, the string “hello” is written to testfile01.txt, but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command. We see from the second example that the &gt;&gt; operator also writes “hello” to a file (in this casetestfile02.txt), but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e. when we run it for the second time). F.1.18 Exercise 2.15.18 Option 3 is correct. For option 1 to be correct we would only run the head command. For option 2 to be correct we would only run the tail command. For option 4 to be correct we would have to pipe the output of head into tail -n 2 by doing head -n 3 animals.txt | tail -n 2 &gt; animals-subset.txt F.1.19 Exercise 2.15.19 Option 4 is the solution. The pipe character | is used to feed the standard output from one process to the standard input of another. &gt; is used to redirect standard output to a file. Try it in the data-shell/molecules directory! F.1.20 Exercise 2.15.20 $ sort salmon.txt | uniq F.1.21 Exercise 2.15.21 The head command extracts the first 5 lines from animals.txt. Then, the last 3 lines are extracted from the previous 5 by using the tail command. With the sort -r command those 3 lines are sorted in reverse order and finally, the output is redirected to a file final.txt. The content of this file can be checked by executing cat final.txt. The file should contain the following lines: 2012-11-06,rabbit 2012-11-06,deer 2012-11-05,raccoon F.1.22 Exercise 2.15.22 $ cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq F.1.23 Exercise 2.15.23 Option 4. is the correct answer. If you have difficulty understanding why, try running the commands, or sub-sections of the pipelines (make sure you are in the data-shell/data directory). F.1.24 Exercise 2.15.24 A solution using two wildcard expressions: shell $ ls *A.txt $ ls *B.txt The output from the new commands is separated because there are two commands. When there are no files ending in A.txt, or there are no files ending in B.txt. F.1.25 Exercise 2.15.25 This would remove .txt files with one-character names This is correct answer The shell would expand * to match everything in the current directory, so the command would try to remove all matched files and an additional file called .txt The shell would expand *.* to match all files with any extension, so this command would delete all files F.1.26 Exercise 2.15.26 The second version is the one we want to run. This prints to screen everything enclosed in the quote marks, expanding the loop variable name because we have prefixed it with a dollar sign. The first version redirects the output from the command echo analyze $file to a file, analyzed-$file. A series of files is generated: analyzed-cubane.pdb, analyzed-ethane.pdb etc. Try both versions for yourself to see the output! Be sure to open the analyzed-*.pdb files to view their contents. F.1.27 Exercise 2.15.27 We have a nested loop, i.e. contained within another loop, so for each species in the outer loop, the inner loop (the nested loop) iterates over the list of temperatures, and creates a new directory for each combination. Try running the code for yourself to see which directories are created! F.1.28 Exercise 2.15.28 The first code block gives the same output on each iteration through the loop. Bash expands the wildcard *.pdb within the loop body (as well as before the loop starts) to match all files ending in .pdb and then lists them using ls. The expanded loop would look like this: $ for datafile in cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb &gt; do &gt; ls cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb &gt; done cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb The second code block lists a different file on each loop iteration. The value of the datafile variable is evaluated using $datafile, and then listed using ls. cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb F.1.29 Exercise 2.15.29 Part 1 4 is the correct answer. * matches zero or more characters, so any file name starting with the letter c, followed by zero or more other characters will be matched. Part 2 4 is the correct answer. * matches zero or more characters, so a file name with zero or more characters before a letter c and zero or more characters after the letter c will be matched. F.1.30 Exercise 2.15.30 Part 1 The text from each file in turn gets written to the alkanes.pdb file. However, the file gets overwritten on each loop interation, so the final content of alkanes.pdb is the text from the propane.pdb file. Part 2 3 is the correct answer. &gt;&gt; appends to a file, rather than overwriting it with the redirected output from a command. Given the output from the cat command has been redirected, nothing is printed to the screen. F.1.31 Exercise 2.15.31 # Script to find unique species in csv files where species is the second data field # This script accepts any number of file names as command line arguments # Loop over all files for file in $@ do echo &quot;Unique species in $file:&quot; # Extract species names cut -d , -f 2 $file | sort | uniq done F.1.32 Exercise 2.15.32 If a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful to know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem. Were the command only be recorded after running it, we would not have a record of the last command run in the event of a crash. F.2 Chapter 3 F.2.1 Exercise 3.8.1 The correct answer is 2. The special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the script, such that the commands run are: $ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb $ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb The shell does not expand '*.pdb' because it is enclosed by quote marks. As such, the first argument to the script is '*.pdb' which gets expanded within the script by head and tail. F.2.2 Exercise 3.8.2 # Shell script which takes two arguments: # 1. a directory name # 2. a file extension # and prints the name of the file in that directory # with the most lines which matches the file extension. wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1 F.2.3 Exercise 3.8.3 In each case, the shell expands the wildcard in *.pdb before passing the resulting list of file names as arguments to the script. Script 1 would print out a list of all files containing a dot in their name. The arguments passed to the script are not actually used anywhere in the script. Script 2 would print the contents of the first 3 files with a .pdb file extension. $1, $2, and $3 refer to the first, second, and third argument respectively. Script 3 would print all the arguments to the script (i.e. all the .pdb files), followed by .pdb. $@ refers to all the arguments given to a shell script. cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb.pdb F.2.4 Exercise 3.8.4 The correct answer is 3, because the -w option looks only for whole-word matches. The other options will also match “of” when part of another word. F.2.5 Exercise 3.8.5 grep -w $1 -r $2 | cut -d : -f 2 | cut -d , -f 1,3 &gt; $1.txt You would call the script above like this: $ bash count-species.sh bear . F.2.6 Exercise 3.8.6 for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy do echo $sis: &gt; grep -ow $sis LittleWomen.txt | wc -l done Alternative, slightly inferior solution: for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy do echo $sis: &gt; grep -ocw $sis LittleWomen.txt done This solution is inferior because grep -c only reports the number of lines matched. The total number of matches reported by this method will be lower if there is more than one match per line. F.2.7 Exercise 3.8.7 The correct answer is 1. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents the shell expanding it, so it gets passed to the find command. Option 2 is incorrect because the shell expands *s.txt instead of passing the wildcard expression to find. Option 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files for lines which do not match “temp”, rather than searching the file names. F.2.8 Exercise 3.8.8 Find all files with a .dat extension recursively from the current directory Count the number of lines each of these files contains Sort the output from step 2. numerically F.2.9 Exercise 3.8.9 Assuming that Nelle’s home is our working directory we type: $ find ./ -type f -mtime -1 -user ahmed F.2.10 Exercise 3.8.10 FIXME: write solution for combining options exercise F.2.11 Exercise 3.8.11 FIXME: write solution for wildcards exercise F.3 Chapter 7 Exercise 7.12.1 Add a rule to Makefile to create a summary CSV file from all of the book CSV files. Be careful about writing the prerequisites so that it doesn’t depend on itself. Exercise 7.12.2 Make it depend on the summary. Exercise 7.12.3 Why is mkdir -p useful? Exercise 7.12.4 Write a rule to report which result files would actually change. Hint: use diff. Exercise 7.12.5 Modify the command in the help action to remove the leading ‘##’ markers from the output. Exercise 7.12.6 What is wrong with writing the rule for results/collated.csv like this: results/collated.csv : results/*.csv $(RUN_COLLATE) $^ &gt; $@ Hint: the fact that the result no longer depends on the program used to create it isn’t the only problem. F.4 Chapter 4 Exercise 4.8.1 Frances does not need to make the univac subdirectory a Git repository because the eniac repository will track everything inside it regardless of how deeply nested. Frances shouldn’t run git init in univac because nested Git repositories can interfere with each other. If someone commits something in the inner repository, Git will not know whether to record the changes in that repository, the outer one, or both. Exercise 4.8.2 Would only create a commit if files have already been staged. Would try to create a new repository. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit. Would try to commit a file “my recent changes” with the message myfile.txt. Exercise 4.8.3 Change names.txt and old-computers.txt using an editor like Nano. Add both files to the staging area with git add *.txt. Check that both files are there with git status. Commit both files at once with git commit. Exercise 4.8.4 Go into your home directory with cd ~. Create a new folder called bio with mkdir bio. Go into it with cd bio. Turn it into a repository with git init. Create your biography using Nano or another text editor. Add it and commit it in a single step with git commit -a -m \"Some message\". Modify the file. Use git diff to see the differences. Exercise 4.8.5 To ignore only the contents of results/plots, add this line to .gitignore: results/plots/ Exercise 4.8.6 Add the following two lines to .gitignore: *.dat # ignore all data files !final.dat # except final.data The exclamation point ! includes a previously-excluded entry. Note also that if we have previously committed .dat files in this repository they will not be ignored once these rules are added to .gitignore. Only future .dat files will be ignored. Exercise 4.8.7 The left button (with the picture of a clipboard) copies the full identifier of the commit to the clipboard. In the shell, git log shows the full commit identifier for each commit. The middle button shows all of the changes that were made in that particular commit; green shaded lines indicate additions and red lines indicate removals. We can show the same thing in the shell using git diff or git diff from..to (where from and to are commit identifiers). The right button lets us view all of the files in the repository at the time of that commit. To do this in the shell, we would need to check out the repository as it was at that commit using git checkout id. If we do this, we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterward. Exercise 4.8.8 GitHub displays timestamps in a human-readable relative format (i.e. “22 hours ago” or “three weeks ago”). However, if we hover over the timestamp we can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred. Exercise 4.8.9 Committing updates our local repository. Pushing sends any commits we have made locally that aren’t yet in the remote repository to the remote repository. Exercise 4.8.10 When GitHub creates a README.md file while setting up a new repository, it actually creates the repository and then commits the README.md file. When we try to pull from the remote repository to our local repository, Git detects that their histories do not share a common origin and refuses to merge them. $ git pull origin master warning: no common commits remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done. remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done. From https://github.com/frances/eniac * branch master -&gt; FETCH_HEAD * [new branch] master -&gt; origin/master fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories We can force git to merge the two repositories with the option --allow-unrelated-histories. Please check the contents of the local and remote repositories carefully before doing this. Exercise 4.8.11 The answer is (5)-Both 2 and 4. The checkout command restores files from the repository, overwriting the files in our working directory. Answers 2 and 4 both restore the latest version in the repository of the file data_cruncher.sh. Answer 2 uses HEAD to indicate the latest, while answer 4 uses the unique ID of the last commit, which is what HEAD means. Answer 3 gets the version of data_cruncher.sh from the commit before HEAD, which is not what we want. Answer 1 can be dangerous: without a filename, git checkout will restore all files in the current directory (and all directories below it) to their state at the commit specified. This command will restore data_cruncher.sh to the latest commit version, but will also reset any other files we have changed to that version, which will erase any unsaved changes you may have made to those files. Exercise 4.8.12 The answer is 2. The command git add history.txt adds the current version of history.txt to the staging area. The changes to the file from the second echo command are only applied to the working copy, not the version in the staging area. As a result, when git commit -m \"Origins of ENIAC\" is executed, the version of history.txt committed to the repository is the one from the staging area with only one line. However, the working copy still has the second line. (git status will show that the file is modified.) git checkout HEAD history.txt therefore replaces the working copy with the most recently committed version of history.txt, so cat history.txt prints: ENIAC was the world&#39;s first general-purpose electronic computer.

What types of data was collected and used for analysis? Interview data and a data from a database on court decisions. Can you find information on the demographics of the interviewees? This information is not available within the documentation. Information on their jobs and opinions are there, but the participant demographics are only described within the associated article. The difficulty is that the article is not linked within the documentation or the metadata. This dataset is clearly in support of an article. What information can you find about it, and can you find a link to it? We can search the dataset name and authorname trying to find this. A search for “National Science Foundation (1228602)”, which is the grant information, finds the grant page https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1228602. Two articles are linked there, but both the DOI links are broken. We can search with the citation for each paper to find them. The Forced Migration article can be found at https://www.fmreview.org/fragilestates/meili but uses a different subset of interviews and does not mention demographics nor links to the deposited dataset. The Boston College Law Review article at https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3318&amp;context=bclr has the same two problems of different data and no dataset citation. Searching more broadly through Meili’s work, we can find this article: Stephen Meili: “Do Human Rights Treaties Help Asylum-Seekers?: Lessons from the United Kingdom” (October 1, 2015). Minnesota Legal Studies Research Paper No. 15-41. Available at SSRN https://ssrn.com/abstract=2668259 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2668259. This does list the dataset as a footnote and reports the 51 interviews with demographic data on reported gender of the interviewees. This paper lists data collection as 2010-2014, while the other two say 2010-2013. We might come to a conclusion that this extra year is where the extra 9 interviews come in, but that difference is not explained anywhere. F.6.2 Exercise 9.14.4 https://web.archive.org/web/20191105173924/https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/accessibility-posters/posters/accessibility-posters.pdf "],["yaml.html", "G YAML", " G YAML YAML is a way to write nested data structures in plain text that is often used to specify configuration options for software. The acronym stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”, but that’s a lie: YAML doesn’t use &lt;tags&gt; like HTML, but can still be quite fussy about what is allowed to appear where. A simple YAML file has one key-value pair on each line with a colon separating the key from the value: project-name: planet earth purpose: science fair moons: 1 Here, the keys are \"project-name\", \"purpose\", and \"moons\", and the values are \"planet earth\", \"science fair\", and (hopefully) the number 1, since most YAML implementations try to guess the type of data. If we want to create a list of values without keys, we can write it either using square brackets (like a Python array) or dashed items (like a Markdown list), so: rotation-time: [&quot;1 year&quot;, &quot;12 months&quot;, &quot;365.25 days&quot;] and: rotation-time: - 1 year - 12 months - 365.25 days are equivalent. (The indentation isn’t absolutely required in this case, but helps make the intenton clear.) If we want to write entire paragraphs, we can use a marker to show that a value spans multiple lines: feedback: | Neat molten core concept. Too much water. Could have used more imaginative ending. We can also add comments using # just as we do in many programming languages. YAML is easy to understand when used this way, but it starts to get tricky as soon as sub-lists and sub-keys appear. For example, this is part of the YAML configuration file for formatting this book: bookdown::gitbook: pandoc_args: [&quot;--csl&quot;, &quot;./csl/jcb.csl&quot;] highlight: tango config: download: [&quot;pdf&quot;, &quot;epub&quot;] toc: collapse: section before: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;Merely Useful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; sharing: no It corresponds to the following Python data structure: { &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;: { &#39;pandoc_args&#39;: [ &#39;--csl&#39;, &#39;./csl/jcb.csl&#39; ], &#39;highlight&#39;: &#39;tango&#39;, &#39;config&#39;: { &#39;download&#39;: [ &#39;pdf&#39;, &#39;epub&#39; ], &#39;toc&#39;: { &#39;collapse&#39;: &#39;section&#39;, &#39;before&#39;: &#39;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;Merely Useful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&#39; } &#39;sharing&#39;: False } } } "],["ssh.html", "H Working Remotely H.1 How can I log in to a remote computer? H.2 How can I copy files to and from a remote computer? H.3 How can I run commands on a remote computer? H.4 How can I create keys so that I don’t have to keep typing my password? H.5 What directories and files does SSH depend on?", " H Working Remotely When the Internet was young, people didn’t encrypt anything except the most sensitive information when sending it over a network. However, this meant that villains could steal usernames and passwords. The [SSH protocol][ssh-protocol] was invented to prevent this (or at least slow it down). It uses several sophisticated (and heavily tested) encryption protocols to ensure that outsiders can’t see what’s in the messages going back and forth between different computers. To understand how it works, let’s take a closer look at what happens when we use the shell on a desktop or laptop computer. The first step is to log in so that the operating system knows who we are and what we’re allowed to do. We do this by typing our username and password; the operating system checks those values against its records, and if they match, runs a shell for us. As we type commands, characters are sent from our keyboard to the shell. It displays those characters on the screen to represent what we type, and then executes the command and displays its output (if any). If we want to run commands on another machine, such as the server in the basement that manages our database of experimental results, we have to log in to that machine so that our commands will go to it instead of to our laptop. We call this a [remote login][remote-login]. H.1 How can I log in to a remote computer? In order for us to be able to login, the remote computer must run a [remote login server][remote-login-server] and we must run a program that can talk to that server. The client program passes our login credentials to the remote login server; if we are allowed to login, that server then runs a shell for us on the remote computer. FIXME: diagram of SSH Once our local client is connected to the remote server, everything we type into the client is passed on, by the server, to the shell running on the remote computer. That remote shell runs those commands on our behalf, just as a local shell would, then sends back output, via the server, to our client, for our computer to display. The remote login server which accepts connections from client programs is known as the [SSH daemon][ssh-daemon], or sshd. The client program we use to login remotely is the [secure shell][secure-shell], or ssh. It has a companion program called scp that allows us to copy files to or from a remote computer using the same kind of encrypted connection. To make a remote login, we issue the command ssh username@computer which tries to make a connection to the SSH daemon running on the remote computer we have specified. After we log in, we can use the remote shell to use the remote computer’s files and directories. Typing exit or Control-D terminates the remote shell, and the local client program, and returns us to our previous shell. In the example below, the remote machine’s command prompt is moon&gt; instead of $ to make it clearer which machine is doing what. $ pwd /Users/amira $ ssh amira@moon.euphoric.edu Password: ******** moon&gt; hostname moon moon&gt; pwd /Users/amira moon&gt; ls -F bin/ cheese.txt dark_side/ rocks.cfg moon&gt; exit $ pwd /Users/amira H.2 How can I copy files to and from a remote computer? To copy a file, we specify the source and destination paths, either of which may include computer names. If we leave out a computer name, scp assumes we mean the machine we’re running on. For example, this command copies our latest results to the backup server in the basement, printing out its progress as it does so: $ scp results.dat amira@backupserver:backups/results-2019-11-11.dat Password: ******** results.dat 100% 9 1.0 MB/s 00:00 Note the colon :, seperating the hostname of the server and the pathname of the file we are copying to. It is this character that informs scp that the source or target of the copy is on the remote machine and the reason it is needed can be explained as follows: In the same way that the default directory into which we are placed when running a shell on a remote machine is our home directory on that machine, the default target, for a remote copy, is also the home directory. This means that $ scp results.dat amira@backupserver: would copy results.dat into our home directory on backupserver, however, if we did not have the colon to inform scp of the remote machine, we would still have a valid commmad $ scp results.dat amira@backupserver but now we have merely created a file called amira@backupserver on our local machine, as we would have done with cp. $ cp results.dat amira@backupserver Copying a whole directory betwen remote machines uses the same syntax as the cp command: we just use the -r option to signal that we want copying to be recursively. For example, this command copies all of our results from the backup server to our laptop: $ scp -r amira@backupserver:backups ./backups Password: ******** results-2019-09-18.dat 100% 7 1.0 MB/s 00:00 results-2019-10-04.dat 100% 9 1.0 MB/s 00:00 results-2019-10-28.dat 100% 8 1.0 MB/s 00:00 results-2019-11-11.dat 100% 9 1.0 MB/s 00:00 H.3 How can I run commands on a remote computer? Here’s one more thing the ssh client program can do for us. Suppose we want to check whether we have already created the file backups/results-2019-11-12.dat on the backup server. Instead of logging in and then typing ls, we could do this: $ ssh amira@backupserver &quot;ls results*&quot; Password: ******** results-2019-09-18.dat results-2019-10-28.dat results-2019-10-04.dat results-2019-11-11.dat Here, ssh takes the argument after our remote username and passes them to the shell on the remote computer. (We have to put quotes around it to make it look like a single argument.) Since those arguments are a legal command, the remote shell runs ls results for us and sends the output back to our local shell for display. H.4 How can I create keys so that I don’t have to keep typing my password? Typing our password over and over again is annoying, especially if the commands we want to run remotely are in a loop. To remove the need to do this, we can create an [SSH key][ssh-key] to tell the remote machine that it should always trust us. SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub, and a private key that is stored only on our computer. If the keys match, we are granted access. The cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse engineer our private key from the public one. We might already have an SSH key pair on your machine. We can check by moving to your .ssh directory and listing the contents. $ cd ~/.ssh $ ls If we see id_rsa.pub, we already have a key pair and don’t need to create a new one. If we don’t see id_rsa.pub, this command will generate a new key pair. (Make sure to replace your@email.com with your own email address.) $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your@email.com&quot; When asked where to save the new key, press enter to accept the default location. Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa): We will then be asked to provide an optional passphrase. This can be used to make your key even more secure, but if we want to avoid typing our password every time we can skip it by pressing enter twice: Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: When key generation is complete, we should see the following confirmation: Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your@email.com The key&#39;s randomart image is: +--[ RSA 2048]----+ | | | | | . E + | | . o = . | | . S = o | | o.O . o | | o .+ . | | . o+.. | | .+=o | +-----------------+ (The random art image is an alternate way to match keys.) We now need to place a copy of our public key on any servers we would like to to connect to. Display the contents of our public key file with cat: $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA879BJGYlPTLIuc9/R5MYiN4yc/YiCLcdBpSdzgK9Dt0B kfe3rSz5cPm4wmehdE7GkVFXrBJ2YHqPLuM1yx1AUxIebpwlIl9f/aUHOts9eVnVh4NztPy0iSU/Sv0b 2ODQQvcy2vYcujlorscl8JjAgfWsO3W4iGEe6QwBpVomcME8IU35v5VbylM9ORQa6wvZMVrPECBvwItT Y8cPWH3MGZiK/74eHbSLKA4PY3gM4GHI450Nie16yggEg2aTQfWA1rry9JYWEoHS9pJ1dnLqZU3k/8OW gqJrilwSoC5rGjgp93iu0H8T6+mEHGRQe84Nk1y5lESSWIbn6P636Bl3uQ== your@email.com Copy the contents of the output, then log in to the remote server as usual: $ ssh amira@moon.euphoric.edu Password: ******** Paste the copied content at the end of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. moon&gt; nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys After appending the content, log out of the remote machine and try to log in again. If we set up the SSH key correctly we won’t need to type our password: moon&gt; exit $ ssh amira@moon.euphoric.edu H.5 What directories and files does SSH depend on? The example of copying our public key to a remote machine, so that it can then be used when we next SSH into that remote machine, assumed that we already had a directory ~/.ssh/. Whilst a remote server may support the use of SSH to login, your home directory there may not contain a .ssh directory by default. We have already seen that we can use SSH to run commands on remote machines, so we can ensure that everything is set up as required before we place the copy of our public key on a remote machine. Walking through this process allows us to highlight some of the typical requirements of the SSH protocol itself, as documented in the man-page for the ssh command. Firstly, we check that we have a .ssh/ directory on another remote machine, comet $ ssh amira@comet &quot;ls -ld ~/.ssh&quot; Password: ******** ls: cannot access /Users/amira/.ssh: No such file or directory Oops: we should create the directory and check that it’s there: $ ssh amira@comet &quot;mkdir ~/.ssh&quot; Password: ******** $ ssh amira@comet &quot;ls -ld ~/.ssh&quot; Password: ******** drwxr-xr-x 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:09 /Users/amira/.ssh Now we have a .ssh directory, into which to place SSH-related files but we can see that the default permissions allow anyone to inspect the files within that directory. For a protocol that is supposed to be secure, this is not considered a good thing and so the recommended permissions are read/write/execute for the user, and not accessible by others. Let’s alter the permissions on the directory: $ ssh amira@comet &quot;chmod 700 ~/.ssh; ls -ld ~/.ssh&quot; Password: ******** drwx------ 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:09 /Users/amira/.ssh That looks much better. In the above example, it was suggested that we paste the content of our public key at the end of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, however as we didn’t have a ~/.ssh/ on this remote machine, we can simply copy our public key over as the initial ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and of course, we will use scp to do this, even though we don’t yet have passwordless SSH access set up. $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub amira@comet:.ssh/authorized_keys Password: ******** Note that the default target for the scp command on a remote machine is the home directory, so we have not needed to use the shorthand ~/.ssh/ or even the full path /Users/amira/.ssh/ to our home directory there. Checking the permissions of the file we have just created on the remote machine, also serves to indicate that we no longer need to use our password, because we now have what’s needed to use SSH without it. $ ssh amira@comet &quot;ls -l ~/.ssh&quot; -rw-r--r-- 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:11 /Users/amira/.ssh/authorized_keys Whilst the authorized keys file is not considered to be highly sensitive, (after all, it contains public keys), we alter the permissions to match the man page’s recommendations $ ssh amira@comet &quot;chmod go-r ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; ls -l ~/.ssh&quot; -rw------- 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:11 /Users/amira/.ssh/authorized_keys "],["references.html", "References", " References Aurora, V., and M.
