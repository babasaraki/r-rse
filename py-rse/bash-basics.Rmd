# The Basics of the Unix Shell {#py-rse-bash-basics}

```{r py-rse-bash-setup, include=FALSE}
source(here::here("_common.R"))
```

Computers do four basic things:
store data,
run programs,
talk with each other,
and interact with people.
They do the last of these in many different ways,
of which [graphical user interfaces][gui] (GUI) are the most widely used.
The computer displays icons to show our files and programs,
and we tell it to copy or run those by clicking with a mouse.
GUIs are easy to learn but hard to automate,
and don't create a record of what we did.

In contrast,
when we use a [command-line interface][cli] (CLI)
we communicate with the computer by typing commands,
and the computer responds by displaying text.
CLIs existed long before GUIs;
they have survived because they are efficient,
easy to automate,
and automatically record what we have done.

The heart of every CLI is a [read-evaluate-print loop][repl] (REPL).
When we type a command and press <kbd>Return</kbd> (also called <kbd>Enter</kbd>)
the CLI <strong>r</strong>eads the command,
<strong>e</strong>valuates it (i.e., executes it),
<strong>p</strong>rints the command's output,
and <strong>l</strong>oops around to wait for another command.
If you have used an interactive console for R or Python,
you have already used a simple CLI.

This lesson introduces another CLI that lets us interact with our computer's operating system.
It is called a [command shell][command-shell],
or just "shell" for short,
and in essence is a program that runs other programs on our behalf
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-repl)).
Those "other programs" can do things as simple as telling us the time
or as complex as modeling global climate change;
as long as they obey a few simple rules,
the shell can run them without having to know what language they are written in
or how they do what they do.

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-repl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Shell"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

The shell's greatest strength is that
it lets us combine programs to create pipelines
that can handle large volumes of data.
Sequences of commands can be saved in a [script][script],
just as commands for R or Python can be saved in programs,
which makes our workflows more reproducible.
Finally,
the shell is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines---in fact,
the shell is practically essential for working with clusters and the cloud.
We won't need this much power in our Zipf's Law examples,
but as we will see,
being able to combine commands and save our work
makes life easier even when working on small problems.

Many of the explanations and exercises below
have been adapted from Software Carpentry's lesson
[The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

## Exploring Files and Directories {#py-rse-bash-basics-explore}

When Bash runs it presents us with a [prompt][prompt] to indicate that it is waiting for input.
By default,
this prompt is a simple dollar sign:

```shell
$
```

However,
different shells may use a different symbol:
in particular,
the `zsh` shell that is the default on newer version of MacOS uses `%`.
As we'll see in Chapter \@ref(py-rse-bash-advanced),
we can customize the prompt to give us more information.

> **Don't Type the Dollar Sign**

> particularly when several commands appear in a row,
> but you should *not* type it yourself.

Let's run a command to find out who the shell thinks we are:

```shell
$ whoami
```

```text
amira
```

> **Learn by Doing**
>
> Amira is one of the learners described in Section \@ref(py-rse-intro-personas).

> we'll present code and examples from her perspective.
> You should follow along on your own computer,
> though what you see might deviate in small ways because of differences in operating system
> (and because your name probably isn't Amira).

Now that we know who we are,
we can explore where we are and what we have.
The part of the operating system that manages files and directories (also called [folders][folder])
is called the [filesystem][filesystem].
Some of the most commonly-used commands in the shell create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
Let's start exploring them by running the command `pwd`,
which stands for <strong>p</strong>rint <strong>w</strong>orking <strong>d</strong>irectory.
The "print" part of its name is straightforward;
the "working directory" part refers to the fact that
the shell keeps track of our [current working directory][current-working-directory] at all times.
Most commands read and write files in the current working directory
unless we tell them to do something else,
so knowing where we are before running a command is important.

```shell
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

Here,
the computer's response is `/Users/amira`,
which tells us that we are in a directory called `amira`
that is contained in a top-level directory called `Users`.
This directory is Amira's [home directory][home-directory];
to understand what that means,
we must first understand how the filesystem is organized.
On Amira's computer
it looks like Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-filesystem).

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-filesystem, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sample Filesystem"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

At the top is the [root directory][root-directory] that holds everything else,
which we can refer to using a slash character, `/` on its own.
Inside that directory are several other directories,
including `bin` (where some built-in programs are stored),
`data` (for miscellaneous data files),
`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and `Users` (where users' personal directories are located).
We know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/` because its name begins with `/`,
and that our current working directory `/Users/amira` is stored inside `/Users`
because `/Users` is the first part of its name.
A name like this is called a [path][path] because it tells us
how to get from one place in the filesystem (e.g., the root directory)
to another (e.g., Amira's home directory).

> **Slashes**
>
> The `/` character means two different things in a path.
> At the front of a path or on its own,
> it refers to the root directory.
> When it appears inside a name, it is a separator.
> Windows uses backslashes (`\\`) instead of forward slashes as separators.

Underneath `/Users`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine.
Jun's files are stored in `/Users/jun`,
Sami's in `/Users/sami`,
and Amira's in `/Users/amira`.
This is where the name "home directory" comes from:
when we first log in,
the shell puts us in the directory that holds our files.

> **Home Directory Variations**
>
> Our home directory will be in different places on different operating systems.
> On Linux it may be `/home/amira`,
> and on Windows it may be `C:\Documents and Settings\amira` or `C:\Users\amira`
> (depending on the version of Windows).
> Our examples show what we would see on MacOS.

Now that we know where we are,
let's see what we have using the command `ls`
(short for "listing"),
which prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory:

```shell
$ ls
```

```text
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public         todo.txt
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures     zipf
```

Again,
our results may be different depending on our operating system
and what files or directories we have.

We can make the output of `ls` more informative using the `-F` [option][command-option]
(also sometimes called a [switch][command-switch] or a [flag][command-flag]).
Options are exactly like arguments to a function in R or Python;
in this case,
`-F` tells `ls` to decorate its output to show what things are.
A trailing `/` indicates a directory,
while a trailing `*` tell us something is a runnable program.
Depending on our setup,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.

```shell
$ ls -F
```

```text
Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/        todo.txt
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/     zipf/
```

Here,
we can see that almost everything in our home directory is a [subdirectory][subdirectory];
the only thing that isn't is a file called `todo.txt`.

> **Spaces Matter**

Some options tell a command how to behave,
but others tell it what to act on.
For example,
if we want to see what's in the `/Users` directory,
we can type:

```shell
$ ls /Users
```

```text
amira   jun     sami
```

We often call the file and directory names that we give to commands [arguments][command-argument]
to distinguish them from the built-in options.
We can combine options and arguments:

```shell
$ ls -F /Users
```

```text
amira/  jun/    sami/
```

but we must put the options (like `-F`)
before the names of any files or directories we want to work on,
because once the command encounters something that *isn't* an option
it assumes there aren't any more:

```shell
$ ls /Users -F
```

```text
ls: -F: No such file or directory
amira   jun     sami
```

## Moving Around {#py-rse-bash-basics-navigate}

Let's run `ls` again.
Without any arguments,
it shows us what's in our current working directory:

```shell
$ ls -F
```

```text
Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/        todo.txt
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/     zipf/
```

If we want to see what's in the `zipf` directory
we can ask `ls` to list its contents:

```shell
$ ls -F zipf
```

```text
data/
```

Notice that `zipf` doesn't have a leading slash before its name.
This absence tells the shell that it is a [relative path][relative-path],
i.e.,
that it identifies something starting from our current working directory.
In contrast,
a path like `/Users/amira` is an [absolute path][absolute-path]:
it is always interpreted from the root directory down,
so it always refers to the same thing.
Using a relative path is like telling someone to go two kilometers north and then half a kilometer east;
using an absolute path is like giving them the latitude and longitude of their destination.

We can use whichever kind of path is easiest to type,
but if we are going to do a lot of work with the data in the `zipf` directory,
the easiest thing would be to change our current working directory
so that we don't have to type `zipf` over and over again.
The command to do this is `cd`,
which stands for <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory.
This name is a bit misleading because the command doesn't change the directory;
instead, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
Let's try it out:

```shell
$ cd zipf
```

`cd` doesn't print anything.
This is normal:
many shell commands run silently unless something goes wrong,
on the theory that they should only ask for our attention when they need it.
To confirm that `cd` has done what we asked,
we can use `pwd`:

```shell
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/zipf
```

```shell
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/
```

> **Missing Directories and Unknown Options**

> it will usually print an error message and (if we're lucky)

>
> ```text
> -bash: cd: whoops: No such file or directory
> ```

We now know how to go down the directory tree,
but how do we go up?
This doesn't work:

```shell
$ cd amira
```

```text
cd: amira: No such file or directory
```

because `amira` on its own is a relative path meaning
"a file or directory called `amira` *below our current working directory*".
To get back home,
we can either use an absolute path:

```shell
$ cd /Users/amira
```

or a special relative path called `..` (two periods in a row with no spaces),
which always means "the directory that contains the current one".
The directory that contains the one we are in is called the [parent directory][parent-directory],
and sure enough,
`..` gets us there:

```shell
$ cd ..
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

`ls` usually doesn't show us this special directory—since it's always there,
displaying it every time would be a distraction.
We can ask `ls` to include it using the `-a` option,
which stands for "all".
Remembering that we are now in `/Users/amira`:

```shell
$ ls -F -a
```

```text
./              Applications/   Documents/      Library/        Music/          Public/         todo.txt
../             Desktop/        Downloads/      Movies/         Pictures/       zipf/
```

The output also shows another special directory called `.` (a single period),
which refers to the current working directory.
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

The special names `.` and `..` don't belong to `cd`:
they mean the same thing to every program.
For example,
if we are in `/Users/amira/zipf`,
then `ls ..` will display a listing of `/Users/amira`.
When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined,
programmers say they are [orthogonal][orthogonality].
Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
because there are fewer special cases to remember.

`cd` is a simple command,
but it allows us to explore several new ideas.
First,
several `..` can be joined by the path separator
to move higher than the parent directory in a single step.
For example, `cd ../..` will move us up two directories
(e.g., from `/Users/amira/zipf` to `/Users`),
while `cd ../Movies` will move us up from `zipf` and back down into `Movies`.

What happens if we type `cd` on its own without giving a directory?

```shell
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/Movies
```

```shell
$ cd
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

No matter where we are,
`cd` on its own always returns us to our home directory.
We can achieve the same thing using the special directory name `~`,
which is a shortcut for our home directory:

```shell
$ ls ~
```

```text
Applications    Documents       Library         Music           Public          todo.txt
Desktop         Downloads       Movies          Pictures        zipf
```

(`ls` doesn't show any trailing slashes here because we haven't used `-F`.)
We can use `~` in paths,
so that (for example) `~/Downloads` always refers to our download directory.

Finally,
`cd` interprets the shortcut `-` (a single dash) to mean the last directory we were in.
Using this is usually faster and more reliable than trying to remember and type the path,
but unlike `~`,
it only works with `cd`:
`ls -` tries to print a listing of a directory called `-`
rather than showing us the contents of our previous directory.

## Creating New Files and Directories {#py-rse-bash-basics-filedir}

We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them?
To find out,
let's go back to our `zipf` directory:

```shell
$ cd ~/zipf
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/
```

To create a new directory,
we use the command `mkdir` (short for <strong>m</strong>a<strong>k</strong>e <strong>d</strong>irectory):

```shell
$ mkdir analysis
```

Since `analysis` is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash)
the new directory is created below the current working directory:

```shell
$ ls -F
```

```text
analysis/  data/

```

Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a graphical tool.
If we look at the current directory with our computer's file browser
we will see the `analysis` directory there too.
The shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files;
the files and directories themselves are the same.

Since we just created the `analysis` directory,
`ls` doesn't display anything when we ask for a listing of its contents:

```shell
$ ls -F analysis
```

Let's change our working directory to `analysis` using `cd`,
then use a very simple text editor called [Nano][nano] to create a file called `draft.txt`
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-nano)):

```shell
$ cd analysis
$ nano draft.txt
```

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-nano, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Nano Editor"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

When we say "Nano is a text editor" we really do mean "text":
it can only work with plain character data,
not spreadsheets, images, Microsoft Word files, or anything else invented after 1970.
We use it in this lesson because it runs everywhere,
and because it is as simple as something can be and still be called an editor.
However,
that last trait means that we *shouldn't* use it for larger tasks
like writing a program or a paper.

>
> Unlike most modern editors,
> Nano runs *inside* the shell window instead of opening a new window of its own.
> This is a holdover from an era when graphical terminals were a rarity
> and different applications had to share a single screen.

Once Nano is open we can type in a few lines of text,
then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(the Control key and the letter 'O' at the same time)
to save our work.
Nano will ask us what file we want to save it to;
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`.
Once our file is saved,
we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to exit the editor and return to the shell.

> `^G Get Help` means "use <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> to get help"
> and `^O WriteOut` means "use <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to write out the current file".

Nano doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` will show that we have indeed created a new file `draft.txt`:

```shell
$ ls
```

```text
draft.txt
```

## Moving Files and Directories {#py-rse-bash-basics-move}

Let's go back to our `zipf` directory:

```shell
cd ~/zipf
```

The `analysis` directory contains a file called `draft.txt`.
That isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change it using `mv` (short for <strong>m</strong>o<strong>v</strong>e):

```shell
$ mv analysis/draft.txt analysis/prior-work.txt
```

The first argument tells `mv` what we are "moving",
while the second is where it's to go.
"Moving" `analysis/draft.txt` to `analysis/prior-work.txt`
has the same effect as renaming the file:

```shell
$ ls analysis
```

```text
prior-work.txt
```

We must be careful when specifying the destination
because `mv` will overwrite existing files without warning.
An option `-i` (for "interactive") makes `mv` ask us for confirmation before overwriting.
`mv` also works on directories,
so `mv analysis first-paper` would rename the directory without changing its contents.

Now suppose we want to move `prior-work.txt` into the current working directory.
If we don't want to change the file's name,
just its location,
we can provide `mv` with a directory as a destination
and it will move the file there.
In this case,
the directory we want is the special name `.` that we mentioned earlier:

```shell
$ mv analysis/prior-work.txt .
```

`ls` now shows us that `analysis` is empty:

```shell
$ ls analysis
```

and that our current directory now contains our file:

```shell
$ ls
```

```text
analysis/  data/  prior-work.txt
```

If we only want to check that the file exists,
we can give its name to `ls`
just like we can give the name of a directory:

```shell
$ ls prior-work.txt
```

```text
prior-work.txt
```

## Copy Files and Directories {#py-rse-bash-basics-copy}

The `cp` command <strong>c</strong>o<strong>p</strong>ies files.
It works like `mv` except it creates a file instead of moving an existing one
(and no, we don't know why the creators of Unix seemed to be allergic to vowels):

```shell
$ cp prior-work.txt analysis/section-1.txt
```

We can check that`cp` did the right thing
by giving `ls` two arguments
to ask it to list two things at once:

```shell
$ ls prior-work.txt analysis/section-1.txt
```

```text
analysis/section-1.txt  prior-work.txt
```

Notice that `ls` shows the output in alphabetical order.
If we leave off the second filename and ask it to show us a file and a directory
(or multiple directories)
it lists them one by one:

```shell
$ ls prior-work.txt analysis
```

```text
prior-work.txt

analysis:
section-1.txt
```

Copying a directory and everything it contains is a little more complicated.
If we use `cp` on its own,
we get an error message:

```shell
$ cp analysis backup
```

```text
cp: analysis is a directory (not copied).
```

If we really want to copy everything,
we must give `cp` the `-r` option (meaning [<strong>r</strong>ecursive][recursion]:

```shell
$ cp -r analysis backup
```

Once again we can check the result with `ls`:

```shell
$ ls analysis backup
```

```text
analysis/:
section-1.txt

backup/:
section-1.txt
```

## Deleting Files and Directories {#py-rse-bash-basics-rm}

Let's tidy up by removing the `prior-work.txt` file we created in our `zipf` directory.
The command to do this is `rm` (for <strong>r</strong>e<strong>m</strong>ove):

```shell
$ rm prior-work.txt
```

We can confirm the file is gone using `ls`:

```shell
$ ls prior-work.txt
```

```text
ls: prior-work.txt: No such file or directory
```

Deleting is forever:
unlike most GUIs,
the Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted files from.
Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist,
but there is no guarantee they will work,
since the computer may recycle the file's disk space at any time.
In most cases,
when we delete a file it really is gone.

In a half-hearted attempt to stop us from erasing things accidentally,
`rm` refuses to delete directories:

```shell
$ rm analysis
```

```text
rm: analysis: is a directory
```

We can tell `rm` we really want to do this
by giving it the recursive option `-r`:

```shell
$ rm -r analysis
```

`rm -r` should be used with great caution:
in most cases,
it's safest to add the `-i` option (for <strong>i</strong>nteractive)
to get `rm` to ask us to confirm each deletion.
As a halfway measure,
we can use `-v` (for <strong>v</strong>erbose)
to get `rm` to print a message for each file it deletes.
This options works the same way with `mv` and `cp`.

## Wildcards {#py-rse-bash-basics-wildcard}

`zipf/data` contains the text files for several ebooks
from [Project Gutenberg][project-gutenberg]:

```shell
$ ls data
```

```text
README.md         moby_dick.txt
dracula.txt       sense_and_sensibility.txt
frankenstein.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt
jane_eyre.txt     time_machine.txt
```

The `wc` command (short for <strong>w</strong>ord <strong>c</strong>ount)
tells us how many lines, words, and letters there are in one file:

```shell
$ wc data/moby_dick.txt
```

```text
 22331  215832 1276222 data/moby_dick.txt
```

> **What's in a Word?**
>
> `wc` only considers spaces to be word breaks:
> if two words are connected by a long dash---like "dash" and "like"
> in this sentence---then `wc` will count them as one word.

We could run `wc` more times to count find out how many lines there are in the other files,
but that would be a lot of typing
and we could easily make a mistake.
We can't just give `wc` the name of the directory as we do with `ls`:

```shell
$ wc data
```

```text
wc: data: read: Is a directory
```

Instead,
we can use [wildcards][wildcard] to specify a set of files at once.
The most commonly-used wildcard is `*` (a single asterisk).
It matches zero or more characters,
so `data/*.txt` matches all of the text files in the `data` directory:

```text
$ ls data/*.txt
```

```text
data/dracula.txt       data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
data/frankenstein.txt  data/sherlock_holmes.txt
data/jane_eyre.txt     data/time_machine.txt
data/moby_dick.txt
```

while `data/s*.txt` only matches the two whose names begin with an 's':

```shell
$ ls data/s*.txt
```

```text
data/sense_and_sensibility.txt  data/sherlock_holmes.txt
```

Wildcards are expanded to match filenames *before* commands are run,
so they work exactly the same way for every command.
This means that we can use them with `wc` to (for example)
count the number of words in the books with names that contains an underscore:

```shell
$ wc data/*_*.txt
```

```text
  21054  188460 1049294 data/jane_eyre.txt
  22331  215832 1253891 data/moby_dick.txt
  13028  121593  693116 data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053  107536  581903 data/sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582   35527  200928 data/time_machine.txt
  73048  668948 3779132 total
```

or the number of words in Frankenstein:

```shell
$ wc data/frank*.txt
```

```text
  7832  78100 442967 data/frankenstein.txt
```

The exercises will introduce and explore other wildcards.
For now,
we only need to know that
it's possible for a wildcard expression to *not* match anything.
In this case,
the command will usually print an error message:

```shell
$ wc data/*.csv
```

```text
wc: data/*.csv: open: No such file or directory
```

## Reading the Manual {#py-rse-bash-basics-help}

`wc` displays lines, words, and characters by default,
but we can ask it to display only the number of lines:

```shell
$ wc -l data/s*.txt
```

```text
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  26081 total
```

`wc` has other options as well.
We can use the `man` command (short for <strong>man</strong>ual)
to find out what they are:

```shell
$ man wc
```

WC(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    WC(1)

NAME
     wc -- word, line, character, and byte count

SYNOPSIS
     wc [-clmw] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained
     in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the
     standard output.  A line is defined as a string of characters delimited
     by a <newline> character.  Characters beyond the final <newline> charac-
     ter will not be included in the line count.

     A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space
     characters.  White space characters are the set of characters for which
     the iswspace(3) function returns true.  If more than one input file is
     specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on
     a separate line after the output for the last file.

     The following options are available:

     -c      The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard
             output.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.

     -l      The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard
             output.

     -m      The number of characters in each input file is written to the
             standard output.  If the current locale does not support multi-
             byte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.  This will
             cancel out any prior usage of the -c option.

     -w      The number of words in each input file is written to the standard
             output.

     When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by
     that option.  The order of output always takes the form of line, word,
     byte, and file name.  The default action is equivalent to specifying the
     -c, -l and -w options.

     If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is
     displayed.  The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF, or [^D] in
     most environments.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution
     of wc as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The wc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Count the number of characters, words and lines in each of the files
     report1 and report2 as well as the totals for both:

           wc -mlw report1 report2

COMPATIBILITY
     Historically, the wc utility was documented to define a word as a "maxi-
     mal string of characters delimited by <space>, <tab> or <newline> charac-
     ters".  The implementation, however, did not handle non-printing charac-
     ters correctly so that "  ^D^E  " counted as 6 spaces, while
     "foo^D^Ebar" counted as 8 characters.  4BSD systems after 4.3BSD modi-
     fied the implementation to be consistent with the documentation.  This
     implementation defines a "word" in terms of the iswspace(3) function,
     as required by IEEE Std 1003.2 ("POSIX.2").

SEE ALSO
     iswspace(3)

STANDARDS
     The wc utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 ("POSIX.1").

HISTORY
     A wc command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

BSD                            February 23, 2005                           BSD

Manual pages contain a lot of information---often more than we really want.
Some commands have a `--help` option that provides a succinct summary of possibilites,
but the best place to go for help these days is probably the [TLDR][tldr] website.
The acronym stands for "too long, didn't read",
and its help for `wc` displays this:

```
wc
Count words, bytes, or lines.

Count lines in file:
wc -l {{file}}

Count words in file:
wc -w {{file}}

Count characters (bytes) in file:
wc -c {{file}}

Count characters in file (taking multi-byte character sets into account):
wc -m {{file}}

edit this page on github
```

As the last line suggests,
all of its examples are in a public GitHub repository
so that users like you can add the examples you wish it had.
For more information,
we can search on [Stack Overflow][so-bash]
or browse the [GNU manuals][gnu-man]
(particularly those for the [core GNU utilities][gnu-man-coreutils],
which include many of the commands introduced in this lesson).
In all cases,
though,
we need to have some idea of what we're looking for in the first place:
someone who wants to know how many lines there are in a data file
is unlikely to think to look for `wc`.

## Combining Commands {#py-rse-bash-basics-pipe}

Now that we know a few basic commands,
we can introduce one of the shell's most powerful features:
the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.
Let's go into the `zipf/data` directory
and count the number of lines in each file once again:

```shell
$ cd ~/zipf/data
$ wc -l *.txt
```

```text

  15975 dracula.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582 time_machine.txt
  96855 total
```

Which of these books is shortest?
We can check by eye when there are only 16 files,
but what if there were eight thousand?

Our first step toward a solution is to run this command:

```shell
$ wc -l *.txt > lengths.txt
```

The greater-than symbol `>` tells the shell
to [redirect][redirection] the command's output to a file instead of printing it.
Nothing appears on the screen;
instead,
everything that would have appeared has gone into the file `lengths.txt`.
The shell creates this file if it doesn't exist,
or overwrites it if it already exists.
`ls lengths.txt` confirms that the file exists:

```shell
$ ls lengths.txt
```

```text
lengths.txt
```

We can print the contents of `lengths.txt` using `cat`,
which is short for con<strong>cat</strong>enate
(because if we give it the names of several files
it will print them all in order):

```shell
$ cat lengths.txt
```

```text
  15975 dracula.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582 time_machine.txt
  96855 total
```

We can now use `sort` to sort the lines in this file:

```shell
$ sort lengths.txt
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  15975 dracula.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  96855 total

```

Just to be safe,
we should use `sort`'s `-n` option to specify that we want to sort numerically.
Without it,
`sort` would order things alphabetically
so that `10` would come before `2`.

`sort` does not change `lengths.txt`.
Instead,
it sends its output to the screen just as `wc` did.
We can therefore put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called `sorted-lengths.txt`
using `>` once again:

```shell
$ sort lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
```

> **Redirecting to the Same File**
>
> It's tempting to send the output of `sort` back to the file it reads:
>
> ```shell
> $ sort -n lengths.txt > lengths.txt
> ```
>
> However, all this does is wipe out the contents of `lengths.txt`.
> The reason is that when the shell sees the redirection,
> it opens the file on the right of the `>` for writing,
> which erases anything that file contained.
> It then runs `sort`, which finds itself reading from a newly-empty file.

Creating intermediate files with names like `lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt` works,
but keeping track of those files and cleaning them up when they're no longer needed is a burden.
Let's delete the two files we just created:

```shell
rm lengths.txt sorted-lengths.txt
```

We can produce the same result more safely and with less typing
using a [pipe][pipe-unix]:

```shell
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  15975 dracula.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  96855 total
```

The vertical bar `|` between the `wc` and `sort` commands
tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.
Putting it another way,
the downstream command doesn't read from a file.
Instead,
it reads the output of the upstream command.

FIXME: diagram of pipes

We can use `|` to build pipes of any length.
For example,
we can use the command `head` to get just the first three lines of sorted data,
which shows us the three shortest books:

```shell
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

> **Options Can Have Values**
>
> When we write `head -n 3`,
> the value 3 is not input to `head`.
> Instead, it is associated with the option `-n`.
> Many options take values like this,
> such as the names of input files or the background color to use in a plot.

We could always redirect the output to a file
by adding `> shortest.txt` to the end of the pipeline,
thereby retaining our answer for later reference.

In practice,
most Unix users would create this pipeline step by step,
just as we have:
by starting with a single command and adding others one by one,
checking the output after each change.
The shell makes this easy
by letting us move up and down in our [command history][command-history-unix]
with the <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> keys.
We can also edit old commands to create new ones,
so a very common sequence is:

-   Run a command and check its output.
-   Use <kbd>↑</kbd> to bring it up again.
-   Add the pipe symbol `|` and another command to the end of the line.
-   Run the pipe and check its output.
-   Use <kbd>↑</kbd> to bring it up again.
-   And so on.

## How Pipes Work {#py-rse-bash-basics-stdio}

In order to use pipes and redirection effectively,
we need to know a little about how they work.
When a computer runs a program---any program---it creates a [process][process] in memory
to hold the program's instructions and data.
Every process in Unix has an input channel called [standard input][standard-input]
and an output channel called [standard output][standard-output].
(By now you may be surprised that their names are so memorable,
but don't worry:
most Unix programmers call them [stdin][stdin] and [stdout][stdout],
which are pronounced "stuh-Din" and "stuh-Dout").

The shell is a program like any other,
and like any other,
it runs inside a process.
Under normal circumstances its standard input is connected to our keyboard
and its standard output to our screen,
so it reads what we type
and displays its output for us to see (Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-stdio)a).
When we tell the shell to run a program
it creates a new process
and temporarily reconnects the keyboard and stream
to that process's standard input and output (Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-stdio)b).

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-stdio, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Standard I/O"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Redirection with `>` tells the shell to connect the program's standard output to a file
instead of the screen (Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-stdio)c).

If we provide one or more files for the command to read,
as with `sort lengths.txt`,
the program reads data from those files.
If we don't provide any filenames,
though,
the Unix convention is for the program to read from standard input.
We can test this by running `sort` on its own,
typing in a few lines of text,
and then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to signal the end of input.
`sort` will then sort and print whatever we typed:

```shell
$ sort
one
two
three
four
^D
```

```text
four
one
three
two
```

When we create a pipe like `wc *.txt | sort`,
the shell creates one process for each command so that `wc` and `sort` will run simultaneously,
and then connects the standard output of `wc` directly to the standard input of `sort`
(Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-misconnect)).
`wc` doesn't know whether its output is going to the screen,
another program,
or to a file via `>`.
Equally,
`sort` doesn't know if its input is coming from the keyboard or another process;
it just knows that it has to read, sort, and print.

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-misconnect, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Misconnection"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Just as we can redirect standard output with `>`,
we can connect standard input to a file using `<`.
In the case of a single file,
this has the same effect as providing the file's name to the command:

```shell
$ wc < moby_dick.txt
```

```text
    22331  215832 1276222
```

If we try to use redirection with a wildcard,
though,
the shell *doesn't* concatenate all of the matching files:

```shell
$ wc < *.txt
```

```text
-bash: *.txt: ambiguous redirect
```

It also doesn't print the error message to standard output,
which we can prove by redirecting:

```shell
$ wc < *.txt > all.txt
```

```text
-bash: *.txt: ambiguous redirect
```

```shell
$ cat all.txt
```

```text
cat: all.txt: No such file or directory
```

Instead,
every process has a second output channel called [standard error][standard-error]
(or [stderr][stderr]).
Programs use it for error messages
so that their attempts to tell us something has gone wrong don't vanish silently into an output file.
There are ways to redirect standard error,
but doing so is almost always a bad idea.

## Repeating Commands on Many Files {#py-rse-bash-basics-loops}

A [loop][loop-unix] is a way to repeat a set of commands for each item in a list.
We can use them to build complex workflows out of simple pieces,
and (like wildcards)
they reduce the typing we have to do and the number of mistakes we might make.

Let's suppose that we want to take a section out of each book
whose name starts with the letter "s" in the `data` directory.
More specifically,
suppose we want to get the first 8 lines of each book
*after* the 9 lines of license information that appear at the start of the file.
If we only cared about one file,
we could write a pipeline to take the first 17 lines
and then take the last 8 of those:

```shell
$ head -n 17 sense_and_sensibility.txt | tail -n 8
```

If we try to use a wildcard to select files,
we only get 8 lines of output,

The problem is that `head` is producing a single stream of output
containing 17 lines for each file
(along with a header telling us the file's name):

```shell
$ head -n 17 s*.txt

As the output shows,
the loop runs our pipeline once for each file.
There is a lot going on here,
so we will break it down into pieces:

1.  The keywords `for`…`in`…`do`…`done` create the loop,
    and must always appear in that order.

2.  `filename` is a [variable][variable],
    and is just like a variable in R or Python.
    At any moment it contains a value,
    but that value can change over time.

3.  The loop runs once for each item in the list.
    Each time it runs,
    it assigns the next item to the variable.
    In this case `filename` will be `sense_and_sensibility.txt`
    the first time around the loop
    and `sherlock_holmes.txt` the second time.

4.  The commands that the loop executes are called the [body][loop-body] of the loop
    and appear between the keywords `do` and `done`.
    Those commands use the current value of the variable `filename`,
    but to get it,
    we must put a dollar sign `$` in front of the variable's name.
    If we forget and use `filename` instead of `$filename`,
    the shell will think that we are referring to a file
    that is actually called `filename`.

5.  The shell prompt changes from `$`
    to a [continuation prompt][continuation-prompt] `>` as we type in our loop
    to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.
    We don't type the `>`,
    just as we don't type the `$`.
    The continuation prompt `>` has nothing to do with redirection;
    it's used because there are only so many punctuation symbols available.

It is very common to use a wildcard to select a set of files
and then loop over that set to run commands:

```shell
$ for filename in s*.txt
> do
>   head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8

## Variable Names {#py-rse-bash-basics-meaningless}

We should always choose meaningful names for variables,
but we should remember that those names don't mean anything to the computer.
For example,
we have called our loop variable `filename`
to make its purpose clear to human readers,
but we could equally well write our loop as:

```shell
$ for x in s*.txt
> do
>   head -n 17 $x | tail -n 8
> done
```

or as:

```shell
$ for username in s*.txt
> do
>   head -n 17 $username | tail -n 8
> done
```

*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names like `x` and misleading names like `username`
increase the odds of misunderstanding.

## Redoing Things {#py-rse-bash-basics-history}

Loops are useful if we know in advance what we want to repeat,
but if we have already run commands,
we can still repeat.
One way is to use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd>
to go up and down in our command history as described earlier.
Another is to use `history`
to get a list of the last few hundred commands we have run:

```shell
$ history
```

```text
  551  wc -l *.txt | sort -n
  552  wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
  553  wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 1 > shortest.txt
```

We can use an exclamation mark `!` followed by a number
to repeat a recent command:

```shell
$ !552
```

```shell
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

The shell prints the command it is going to re-run to standard error
before executing it,
so that (for example) `!572 > results.txt`
puts the command's output in a file
*without* also writing the command to the file.

Having an accurate record of the things we have done
and a simple way to repeat them
are two of the main reasons people use the Unix shell.
In fact,
being able to repeat history is such a powerful idea
that the shell gives us several ways to do it:

-   `!head` re-runs the most recent command starting with `head`,
    while `!wc` re-runs the most recent starting with `wc`.
-   If we type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> (for <strong>r</strong>everse search)
    the shell searches backward through its history for whatever we type next.
    If we don't like the first thing it finds,
    we can type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> again to go further back.

If we use `history`, <kbd>↑</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
we will quickly notice that loops don't have to be broken across lines.
Instead,
their parts can be separated with semi-colons:

```shell
$ for filename in s*.txt ; do head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8; done
```

This is fairly readable,
although even experienced users have a tendency to put the semi-colon after `do` instead of before it.
If our loop contains multiple commands,
though,
the multi-line format is much easier to read.
For example,
compare this:

```shell
$ for filename in s*.txt
> do
>   echo $filename
>   head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8
> done
```

with this:

```shell
$ for filename in s*.txt; do echo $filename; head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8; done
```

(The `echo` command simply prints its arguments to the screen.
It is often used to keep track of progress or for debugging.)

## Creating New Filenames Automatically {#py-rse-bash-basics-autoname}

Suppose we want to create a backup copy of each book whose name ends in "e".
If we don't want to change the files' names,
we can do this with `cp`:

```shell
$ cd ~/zipf
$ mkdir backup
$ cp data/*e.txt backup
$ ls backup
```

```text
jane_eyre.txt  time_machine.txt
```

> **Warnings and Errors**
>
> In the example above,
> you may have receive the warning:
>
> ```text
> mkdir: backup: File exists
> ```
>
> This warning lets you know the action couldn't be completed,
> but won't affect the rest of the code from executing appropriately.
> If this is the case,
> you'll also likely still have an additional file, `section-1.txt`,
> in your `backup/` directory.
>
> FIXME: I don't understand this callout box: add an explanation or remove it.

But what if we want to append the extension `.bak` to the files' names?
`cp` can do this for a single file:

```shell
$ cp data/time_machine.txt backup/time_machine.txt.bak
```

but not for all the files at once:

```shell
$ cp data/*e.txt backup/*e.txt.bak
```

```text
cp: target 'backup/*e.txt.bak' is not a directory
```

`backup/*e.txt.bak` doesn't match anything---those files don't yet exist---so
after the shell expands the `*` wildcards,
what we are actually asking `cp` to do is:

```shell
$ cp data/jane_eyre.txt data/time_machine.txt backup/*e.bak
```

This doesn't work because `cp` only understands how to do two things:
copy a single file to create another file,
or copy a bunch of files into a directory.
If we give it more than two names as arguments,
it expects the last one to be a directory.
Since `backup/*e.bak` is not,
`cp` reports an error.

Instead,
let's use a loop to copy files to the backup directory
and append the `.bak` suffix:

```shell
$ cd data
$ for filename in *e.txt
> do
>   cp $filename ../backup/$filename.bak
> done
$ ls ../backup
```

```text
jane_eyre.txt.bak  time_machine.txt.bak
```

## Summary {#py-rse-bash-basics-summary}

The original Unix shell was created in 1971,
and will soon celebrate its fiftieth anniversary.
Its commands may be cryptic,
but few programs have remained in daily use for so long.
The secret to its success is the way it combines a few powerful ideas:
command history, wildcards, redirection, and above all pipes.
The next chapter will explore how we can go beyond these basics.

## Exercises {#py-rse-bash-basics-exercises}

The exercises below involve creating and moving new files,
as well as considering hypothetical files.
Please note that if you create or move any files or directories in your Zipf's Law project,
you may want to reorganize your files following the outline at the beginning of the next chapter.
If you accidentally delete necessary files,
you can start with a fresh copy of the data files
by following the instructions in Appendix \@ref(py-rse-install).

### Exploring more `ls` flags {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-more-ls}

What does the command `ls` do when used
with the `-l` option?

What happens if you use two options at the same time, such as `ls -l -h`?

### Listing recursively and by time {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-ls-rt}

The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively,
which means the subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so on at each level are listed.
The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change,
with most recently changed files or directories first.

In what order does `ls -R -t` display things? Hint: `ls -l` uses a long listing
format to view timestamps.

### Absolute and relative paths {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-paths}

Starting from a hypothetical directory located at `/Users/amira/data`,
which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory,
which is `/Users/amira`?

1. `cd .`
2. `cd /`
3. `cd /home/amira`
4. `cd ../..`
5. `cd ~`
6. `cd home`
7. `cd ~/data/..`
8. `cd`
9. `cd ..`
10. `cd ../.`

### Relative path resolution {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-resolve-rel-path}

Using the filesystem shown in Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-ex-rel-path),
if `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`,
what will `ls -F ../backup` display?

1.  `../backup: No such file or directory`
2.  `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
3.  `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
4.  `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-ex-rel-path, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Exercise Filesystem"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

### `ls` reading comprehension {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-reading-ls}

Using the filesystem shown in Figure \@ref(fig:py-rse-bash-basics-ex-reading-ls),
if `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`,
and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order,
what command(s) will result in the following output:

```shell
pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/
```

```{r py-rse-bash-basics-ex-reading-ls, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Filesystem for Exercise"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

1.  `ls pwd`
2.  `ls -r -F`
3.  `ls -r -F /Users/backup`

### Creating files a different way {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-touch}

What happens when you execute `touch my_file.txt`?
(Hint: use `ls -l` to find information about the file)

When might you want to create a file this way?

### Using `rm` safely {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-safe-rm}

What would happen if you executed `rm -i my_file.txt`
on a hypothetical file?
Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?

### Moving to the current folder {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-move-dot}

After running the following commands,
Amira realizes that she put the (hypothetical) files `chapter1.dat` and `chapter2.dat` into the wrong folder:

```shell
$ ls -F
  processed/ raw/
$ ls -F processed
  chapter1.dat chapter2.dat appendix1.dat appendix2.dat
$ cd raw/
```

Fill in the blanks to move these files to the current folder
(i.e., the one she is currently in):

```shell
$ mv ___/chapter1.dat  ___/chapter2.dat ___
```

### Renaming files {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-renaming-files}

Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the
statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: `statstics.txt`

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`

### Moving and copying {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-last-ls}

Assuming the following hypothetical files,
what is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

```shell
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/data
```

```shell
$ ls
```

```text
books.dat
```

```shell
$ mkdir doc
$ mv books.dat doc/
$ cp doc/books.dat ../books-saved.dat
$ ls
```

1.   `books-saved.dat doc`
2.   `doc`
3.   `books.dat doc`
4.   `books-saved.dat`

### Copy with multiple filenames {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-copy-multi}

This exercises explores how `cp` responds when attempting to copy multiple things.

What does `cp` do when given several filenames followed by a directory name?

```shell
$ mkdir backup
$ cp dracula.txt frankenstein.txt backup/
```

What does `cp` do when given three or more file names?

```shell
$ cp dracula.txt frankenstein.txt jane_eyre.txt
```

### List filenames matching a pattern {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-ls-match}

When run in the `data` directory, which `ls` command(s) will
produce this output?

`jane_eyre.txt   sense_and_sensibility.txt`

1. `ls ??n*.txt`
2. `ls *e_*.txt`
3. `ls *n*.txt`
4. `ls *n?e*.txt`

### Organizing directories and files {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-organizing}

Amira is working on a project and she sees that her files aren't very well
organized:

```shell
$ ls -F
```

```text
books.txt    data/    results/   titles.txt
```

The `books.txt` and `titles.txt` files contain output from her data
analysis. What command(s) does she need to run
to produce the output shown?

```shell
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/   results/
```

```shell
$ ls results
```

```text
books.txt    titles.txt
```

### Reproduce a directory structure {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-reproduce-structure}

You're starting a new analysis, and would like to duplicate the directory
structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called '2016-05-18',
which contains a `data` folder that in turn contains folders named `raw` and
`processed` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
of the `2016-05-18-data` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20`
so that your final directory structure looks like this:

	2016-05-20/
	└── data
	    ├── processed
	    └── raw

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?

What would the other commands do?

```shell
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
```

```shell
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

```shell
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```shell
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

### What does `>>` mean? {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-redirect-append}

We have seen the use of `>`, but there is a similar operator `>>` which works slightly differently.
We'll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings.
We can use the `echo` command to print strings e.g.

```shell
$ echo The echo command prints text
```

```text
The echo command prints text
```

Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:

```shell
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
```

and:

```shell
$ echo hello >> testfile02.txt
```

Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.

### Appending data {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-append-data}

Given the following commands,
what will be included in the file `extracted.txt`:

```shell
$ head -n 3 dracula.txt > extracted.txt
$ tail -n 2 dracula.txt >> extracted.txt
```

1. The first three lines of `dracula.txt`
2. The last two lines of `dracula.txt`
3. The first three lines and the last two lines of `dracula.txt`
4. The second and third lines of `dracula.txt`

### Piping commands {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-piping}

In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of
lines. Which command listed below would work?

1. `wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3`
2. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3`
3. `wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n`
4. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3`

### Why does `uniq` only remove adjacent duplicates? {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-uniq-adjacent}

The command `uniq` removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input.
Consider a hypothetical file `genres.txt` containing the following data:

```text
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
science fiction
```

Running the command `uniq genres.txt` produces:

```text
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
```

Why do you think `uniq` only removes *adjacent* duplicated lines?
(Hint: think about very large data sets.) What other command could
you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines?

### Pipe reading comprehension {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-reading-pipes}

A file called `titles.txt` contains the following data:

```text
Sense and Sensibility,1811
Frankenstein,1818
Jane Eyre,1847
Wuthering Heights,1847
Moby Dick,1851
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,1892
The Time Machine,1895
Dracula,1897
The Invisible Man,1897
```

What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below?

```shell
$ cat titles.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r > final.txt
```

Hint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding

### Pipe construction {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-pipe-construction}

For the file `titles.txt` from the previous exercise, consider the following command:

```shell
$ cut -d , -f 2 titles.txt
```

What does the `cut` command (and its options) accomplish?

### Which pipe? {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-which-pipe}

Consider the same `titles.txt` from the previous exercises.

The `uniq` command has a `-c` option which gives a count of the
number of times a line occurs in its input.
If `titles.txt` was in your working directory,
what command would you use to produce
a table that shows the total count of each publication year in the file?

1.  `sort titles.txt | uniq -c`
2.  `sort -t, -k2,2 titles.txt | uniq -c`
3.  `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | uniq -c`
4.  `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | sort | uniq -c`
5.  `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l`

### Wildcard expressions {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-wildcard-expressions}

Wildcard expressions can be very complex, but you can sometimes write
them in ways that only use simple syntax, at the expense of being a bit
more verbose.
In your `data/` directory,
the wildcard expression `[st]*.txt`
matches all files beginning with `s` or `t` and ending with `.txt`.
Imagine you forgot about this.

1.  Can you match the same set of files with basic wildcard expressions
    that do not use the `[]` syntax? *Hint*: You may need more than one
    expression.

2.  The expression that you found and the expression from the lesson match the
    same set of files in this example. What is the small difference between the
    outputs?

3.  Under what circumstances would your new expression produce an error message
    where the original one would not?

### Removing unneeded files {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-remove-unneeded}

Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep
your raw files and processing script to save storage.
The raw files end in `.txt` and the processed files end in `.csv`.
Which of the following would remove all the processed data files,
and *only* the processed data files?

1. `rm ?.csv`
2. `rm *.csv`
3. `rm * .csv`
4. `rm *.*`

### Doing a dry run {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-loop-dry-run}

A loop is a way to do many things at once—or to make many mistakes at
once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop *would* do
is to `echo` the commands it would run instead of actually running them.

Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute
without actually running those commands
(`analyze` is a hypothetical command):

```shell
$ for file in *.txt
> do
>   analyze $file > analyzed-$file
> done
```

What is the difference between the two loops below, and which one would we
want to run?

```shell
# Version 1
$ for file in *.txt
> do
>   echo analyze $file > analyzed-$file
> done
```

```shell
# Version 2
$ for file in *.txt
> do
>   echo "analyze $file > analyzed-$file"
> done
```

### Variables in loops {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-loop-variables}

Given the files in `data/`,
what is the output of the following code?

```shell
$ for datafile in *.txt
> do
>    ls *.txt
> done
```

Now, what is the output of the following code?

```shell
$ for datafile in *.txt
> do
>	ls $datafile
> done
```

Why do these two loops give different outputs?

### Limiting sets of files {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-limiting-file-sets}

What would be the output of running the following loop in your `data/` directory?

```shell
$ for filename in d*
> do
>    ls $filename
> done
```

How would the output differ from using this command instead?

```shell
$ for filename in *d*
> do
>    ls $filename
> done
```

### Saving to a file in a loop {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-loop-save}

Consider running the following loop in the  `data/` directory:

```shell
for book in *.txt
> do
>     echo $book
>     head -n 16 $book > headers.txt
> done
```

Why would the following loop be preferable?

```shell
for book in *.txt
> do
>     head -n 16 $book >> headers.txt
> done
```

### Why does `history` record commands before running them? {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-history-order}

If you run the command:

```shell
$ history | tail -n 5 > recent.sh
```

the last command in the file is the `history` command itself, i.e.,
the shell has added `history` to the command log before actually
running it. In fact, the shell *always* adds commands to the log
before running them. Why do you think it does this?

### Other wildcards {#py-rse-bash-basics-ex-other-wildcards}

The shell provides several wildcards beyond the widely-used `*`.
To explore them,
explain in plain language what files the expression `novel-????-[ab]*.{txt,pdf}` matches and why.

## Key Points {#py-rse-bash-basics-keypoints}

```{r, child="keypoints/rse-bash-basics.md"}
```

```{r, child="./links.md"}
```
