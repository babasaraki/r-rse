Now that we are comfortable using Git at the command line,
we can look at two tools for organizing our development and working with others:
branching and pull requests.
[Branches][git-branch] let us work on multiple things simultaneously in a single repository;
[pull requests][pull-request] (PRs) let us submit our work for review,
get feedback,
and make updates.
Used together,
they allow us to go through the write-review-revise cycle
familiar to anyone who has ever written a journal paper
in hours rather than weeks.

## What is a branch and how do I create one? {#r-rse-git-advanced-create-branch}

The Git lessons so far have all used a sequential timeline:
each change builds on the one before,
and *only* on the one before.
However,
there are times when we want to keep our main work safe from experimental changes.
To do this, we can use [branches][git-branch] to work on separate tasks in parallel.

We can see what branches a repository using this command:

```shell
$ git branch
```

```text
* master
```

When we initialize a repository,
Git automatically creates a branch called [`master`][git-branch-master].
It is often considered the "official" version of the repository.
The asterisk '*' indicates that it is currently active,
i.e.,
that all changes we make will take place in this branch by default.
(The active branch is like the [current working directory][current-working-directory] in the shell.)

Suppose that we are working on an analysis
and don't know whether a [violin plot][violin-plot] or [beeswarm plot][beeswarm-plot]
will make our results clearer.
We decide to create a new branch from `master` for each
and then merge whichever we prefers back to `master` (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-creating-branches)).

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-creating-branches, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Creating Branches"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

After tossing a coin,
we decide to experiment with violin plots first.
To create the branch,
we run:

```shell
$ git branch violin
```

We can check that the branch exists by running `git branch` again:

```shell
$ git branch
```

```text
* master
  violin
```

Our branch is there,
but the asterisk `*` shows that we are still in the `master` branch.
(By analogy,
creating a new directory doesn't automatically move us into that directory.)
As a further check,
let's see what our repository's status is:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

To switch to our new branch we can use the `checkout` command that we first saw in Section \@ref(r-rse-git-cmdline-restore):

```shell
$ git checkout violin
$ git branch
```

```text
  master
* violin
```

`git checkout` doesn't just check out a file from a specific commit:
it can also check out the whole repository,
i.e.,
switch it from one saved state to another
by updating all files in the repository to match the desired state.
A branch is a human-readable name for one such state.
We can (and should) choose the name to signal the purpose of the branch,
just as we choose the names of files and variables to indicate what they are for.

At this point,
`master` and `violin` are two names for the same repository state (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-repo-state)),
so commands like `ls` and `git log` shows that the files and history haven't changed
as we switch from `master` to `violin`.
This will be true until some changes are committed to our new branch.

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-repo-state, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Repository State"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Let's make such a change by editing our analysis script,
adding a lines to create the violin plot,
and committing our changes:

```shell
$ nano bin/analysis.sh
$ git add bin/analysis.sh
$ git commit -m "Created violin plots"
```

```text
[violin 3ff8195] Created violin plots
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

If we look at the last couple of commits using `git log`,
we see our most recent change:

```shell
$ git log --oneline -n 2
```

```text
3ff8195 Created violin plots
64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file
```

(We use `--oneline` and `-n 2` to shorten the log display.)
But let's switch back to the `master` branch:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git branch
```

```text
* master
  violin
```

If we look at the log,
our latest change is not there:

```shell
$ git log --oneline -n 2
```

```text
64b802f (HEAD -> master) Adding overdue .gitignore file
2fe5f6f Updating analysis script
```

We have not lost our work:
it just isn't included in this branch (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-not-lost)).
We can prove this by switching back to the `violin` branch and checking the log again:

```shell
$ git checkout violin
$ git log --oneline -n 2
```

```text
3ff8195 Created violin plots
64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file
```

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-not-lost, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Work Is Not Lost"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

We can also look inside `bin/analysis.sh` and see our changes.
If we make another change and commit it,
that change will also go into the `violin` branch (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-change-into-branch)):

```shell
$ nano bin/analysis.sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding facets to the violin plot"
```

```text
[violin db1d03f] Adding facets to the violin plot
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-change-into-branch, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Change Goes Into Branch"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

And if we want to see the differences between two branches,
we can use `git diff` with the same double-dot `..` syntax we use
to view differences between two revisions:

```shell
$ git diff master..violin
```

```text
diff --git a/bin/analysis.sh b/bin/analysis.sh
index 8de12fa..bbe78f7 100644
--- a/bin/analysis.sh
+++ b/bin/analysis.sh

 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 cat $1 | \
   species --all | \
-  plot --default > \
+  plot --violin --facet=species_name > \
   plots/violin-by-species.png
```

We can repeat this process to experiment with beeswarm plots.
Since we don't want to include any of the violin plot work in this branch,
we make our new branch from `master`.
To speed things up a bit,
we use the `-b` option to `git checkout` to create the branch and switch to it
in a single step:

```shell
$ git checkout master           # make sure of our starting point
$ git checkout -b beeswarm      # make branch and switch to it
$ nano bin/analysis.sh          # make our changes
$ git add bin/analysis.sh       # add our changes
$ git commit -m "Beeswarms"     # we really should use a more informative message
$ git log --oneline -n 2        # show history
```

```text
917823d (HEAD -> beeswarm) Beeswarms
64b802f (master) Adding overdue .gitignore file
```

The log shows that the changes in the `beeswarm` branch are
on top of the changes in the `master` branch,
and do *not* include the changes in the `violin` branch (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-where-changes-are)).
If we're curious,
we can use `git diff` to show the differences between the two plotting branches:

```shell
$ git diff beeswarm..violin
```

```text

## How do I merge work from separate branches? {#r-rse-git-advanced-merge}

After a bit of experimentation,
we decide that we prefer violin plots to beeswarm plots.
We now have three options:

1.  Add our changes to `bin/analysis.sh` once again in the `master` branch.
2.  Stop working in `master` and start using the `violin` branch for future development.
3.  [Merge][git-merge] the `violin` and `master` branches.

The first option is tedious and error-prone,
while the second option will lead to confusion
and doesn't give us a way to combine changes made in two or more branches.
The third option the simplest, fastest, and most reliable.
To start,
let's make sure we're in the `master` branch:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git branch
```

```text
  beeswarm
* master
  violin
```

We can now merge the changes in `violin` branch into our current branch
with a single command:

```shell
$ git merge violin
```

```text
Updating 64b802f..db1d03f
Fast-forward
 bin/analysis.sh | 5 ++++-
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Merging doesn't change the source branch `violin` (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-merging-doesnt-change)).
Once the merge is done,
though,
all of the changes made in `violin` are also in the history of `master`:

```shell
$ git log --oneline -n 4
```

```text
db1d03f (HEAD -> master, violin) Adding facets to the violin plot
3ff8195 Created violin plots
64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file
2fe5f6f Updating analysis script
```

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-merging-doesnt-change, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Merging Doesn't Change Things"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Note that Git automatically creates a new commit (in this case, `db1d03f`) to represent the merge.
If we now run `git diff master..violin`,
Git doesn't print anything
because there aren't any differences to show.

Now that we have merged all of the changes from `violin` into `master`
there is no need to keep the `violin` branch,
so we can delete it:

```shell
$ git branch -d violin
```

```text
Deleted branch violin (was db1d03f).
```

And since we don't want to keep the changes in the `beeswarm` branch,
we can delete it as well:

```shell
$ git branch -d beeswarm
```

```text
error: The branch 'beeswarm' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D beeswarm'.
```

Git refuses to do what we have asked
because we have *not* merged the changes from `beeswarm` into `master`
(or any other branch),
so deleting it actually would erase work.
If we are sure we want to do this,
we would have to follow Git's instructions and use the `-D` option.
We won't do this yet because we can use the changes in the `beeswarm` branch
to illustrate another key feature of Git:
handling conflicts.

> **Not Just the Command Line**
>
> We have been creating, merging, and deleting branches on the command line,
> but we can do all of these things using [GitKraken][gitkraken],
> [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide],
> and other GUIs.
> The operations stay the same;
> all that changes is how we tell the computer what we want to do.

## How do I handle conflicting changes? {#r-rse-git-advanced-conflict}

We now have two branches,
`master` and `beeswarm`,
in which we have changes the same lines of `bin/analysis.sh` in different ways:

```shell
$ git diff beeswarm..master
```

```text
diff --git a/bin/analysis.sh b/bin/analysis.sh
index 2ebd322..bbe78f7 100644
--- a/bin/analysis.sh
+++ b/bin/analysis.sh
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 cat $1 | \
   species --all | \

-  plots/beeswarm-by-species.png
+  plot --violin --facet=species_name > \
+  plots/violin-by-species.png
```

When we try to merge `beeswarm` into `master`,
Git doesn't know which of these changes we want to keep.
This is called a [conflict][git-conflict]:

```shell
$ git merge beeswarm master
```

```text
Auto-merging bin/analysis.sh
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bin/analysis.sh
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

If we look in `bin/analysis.sh`,
we see that Git has kept both sets of changes,
but has marked which came from where:

```shell
$ cat bin/analysis.sh
```

```text
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cat $1 | \
  species --all | \
<<<<<<< HEAD
  plot --violin --facet=species_name > \
  plots/violin-by-species.png
=======
  plot --beeswarm --jitter=0.1 --facet=species_name > \
  plots/beeswarm-by-species.png
>>>>>>> beeswarm
```

The lines from `<<<<<<< HEAD` to `=======` are what was in `master`,
while the lines from there to `>>>>>>> beeswarm` show what was in `beeswarm`.
If there were several conflicting regions in the same file,
Git would mark each one this way.

We have to decide what to do next:
keep the `master` changes,
keep those from `beeswarm`,
edit this part of the file to combine them,
or write something new.
Whatever we do,
we must remove the `>>>`, `===`, and `<<<` markers.
Let's combine the two sets of changes to create side-by-side plots:

```shell
$ nano bin/analysis.sh
$ cat bin/analysis.sh
```

```text
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cat $1 | \
  species --all | \
  plot -n 2 --violin --beeswarm --jitter=0.1 --facet=species_name > \
  plots/by-species.png
```

This counts as yet another change to the file:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

        modified:   bin/analysis.sh

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   bin/analysis.sh
```

Here,
Git thinks that there are changes to be committed because of the merge,
and that `bin/analysis.sh` has been modified again because of our edit.
Let's add the file and commit the change:

```shell
$ git add bin/analysis.sh
$ git commit -m "Merging beeswarm plots"
```

```text
[master b0c3fc6] Merging beeswarm plots
```

The project's history now shows a single sequence of commits,
with the `beeswarm` changes on top of the earlier `violin` changes:

```shell
$ git log --oneline
```

```text
b0c3fc6 (HEAD -> master) Merging beeswarm plots

2fe5f6f Updating analysis script
c89bf68 Northern data
dc4adfb Initial commit
```

If we want to see what really happened,
we can add the `--graph` option to `git log`:

```shell
$ git log --oneline --graph
```

```text

```

## How should I use branches? {#r-rse-git-advanced-workflow}

People use Git in different ways,
but all of those ways rely heavily on branches.
If we are working on our own computer,
this workflow will help us keep track of what we are doing:

1.  `git checkout master` to make sure we are in the `master` branch.

2.  `git checkout -b name-of-feature` to create a new branch.
    We *always* create a branch when making changes,
    since we never know what else might come up.
    The branch name should be as descriptive as a variable name or filename would be.

3.  Make our changes.
    If something occurs to us along the way—for example,
    if we are writing a new function and realize that
    the documentation for some other function should be updated—we do *not*
    do that work in this branch just because we happen to be there.
    Instead,
    we commit our changes,
    switch back to `master`,
    and create a new branch for the other work.

4.  When the new feature is complete,
    we `git merge master name-of-feature`
    to get any changes we merged into `master` after creating `name-of-feature`
    and resolve any conflicts.
    This is an important step:
    we want to do the merge and test that everything still works in our feature branch,
    not in `master`.

5.  Finally,
    we switch back to `master` and `git merge name-of-feature master`
    to merge our changes into `master`.
    We should not have any conflicts,
    and all of our tests should pass.

Most experienced developers use this [branch-per-feature][branch-per-feature] workflow,
but what exactly is a "feature"?
These rules make sense for small projects with or without collaborators:

1.  Anything cosmetic that is only one or two lines long can be done in `master` and committed right away.
    "Cosmetic" means changes to comments or documentation:
    nothing that affects how code runs, not even a simple variable renaming.

2.  A pure addition that doesn't change anything else is a feature and goes into a branch.
    For example,
    if we run a new analysis and save the results,
    that should be done on its own branch
    because it might take several tries to get the analysis to run,
    and we might interrupt ourselves to fix things that we discover aren't working.

3.  Every change to code that someone might want to undo later in one step gets is a feature.
    For example,
    if a new parameter is added to a function,
    then every call to the function has to be updated.
    Since neither alteration makes sense without the other,
    those changes are considered a single feature and should be done in one branch.

The hardest thing about using a branch-per-feature workflow is sticking to it for small changes.
As the first point in the list above suggests,
most people are pragmatic about this on small projects;
on large ones,
where dozens of people might be committing,
even the smallest and most innocuous change needs to be in its own branch
so that it can be reviewed (which we discuss below).

## How can I use someone else's work? {#r-rse-git-advanced-fork}

So far we have used Git to manage individual work,
but it really comes into its own when we are working with other people.
We can do this in two ways:

1.  Everyone has read and write access to a single shared repository.

2.  Everyone can read from the project's main repository,
    but only a few people can commit changes to it.
    The project's other contributors [fork][git-fork] the main repository to create one that they own,
    do their work in that,
    and then submit their changes to the main repository.

The first approach works well for teams of up to half a dozen people
who are all comfortable using Git,
but if the project is larger,
or if contributors are worried that they might make a mess in the `master` branch,
the second approach is safer.

Git itself doesn't have any notion of a "main repository",
but [forges][forge] like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket all encourage people
to use Git in ways that effectively create one.
Suppose,
for example,
that Frances Bilas has put her plotting project online
and that the repository's URL is `https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting`.
Jean Jennings (another of the original ENIAC programmers) would like to contribute to the project,
so she goes to that URL and clicks on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner
(Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-fork-button)).
GitHub immediately creates a copy of Frances's repository within Jean's account on GitHub's own servers.
When the command completes,
the setup on GitHub now looks like this:

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-fork-button, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Forking"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Nothing has happened yet on Jean's own machine:
the new repository exists only on GitHub.
When Jean explores its history,
she sees that it contains all of the changes Frances made.

A copy of a repository is called a [clone][git-clone].
In order to start working on the project,
Jean needs to create a clone of *her* repository (not Frances's) on her own computer.
We will modify Jean's prompt to include her desktop user ID (`jj`)
and her working directory (initially `~`)
to make it easier to follow what's happening:

```shell
jj:~ $ git clone https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git
```

```text
Cloning into 'plotting'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 32, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (32/32), done.

remote: Total 32 (delta 5), reused 32 (delta 5), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (32/32), done.
```

This command creates a new directory with the same name as the project,
i.e., `plotting`.
When Jean goes into this directory and runs `ls` and `git log`,
she sees that all of the project's files and history are there:

```shell
jj:~ $ cd plotting
jj:~/plotting $ ls
```

```text
README.md       bin             data
```

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git log --oneline
```

```text

3ff8195 Created violin plots
64b802f Adding overdue .gitignore file
2fe5f6f Updating analysis script
c89bf68 Northern data
dc4adfb Initial commit
```

She also sees that Git has automatically created a remote for her repository
that points back at her repository on GitHub:

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git remote -v
```

```text
origin  https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (push)
```

Frances's original repository,
Jean's fork on GitHub,
and Jean's new clone on her desktop
are now arranged as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-forked-repos).
Jean can pull changes from her fork and push work back there,
but she needs to do one more thing before she can get changes from Frances's repository:

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git
jj:~/plotting $ git remote -v
```

```text
origin      https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (fetch)
origin      https://github.com/jeanjennings/plotting.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/francesbilas/plotting.git (push)
```

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-forked-repos, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Forked Repositories"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Jean has called her new remote `upstream` because it points at the repository hers are derived from.
She could use any name,
but `upstream` is a nearly universal convention.

With this remote in place,
Jean is finally set up (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-finished-forking)).
Suppose,
for example,
that Frances has modified the project's `README.md` file to add Jean as a contributor.
(Again, we show Frances's user ID and working directory in her prompt to make it clear who's doing what).

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-finished-forking, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Finished Forking"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

```shell

```

```text

```

```shell
frances:~/plotting $ nano README.md
frances:~/plotting $ cat README.md
```

```text

-   Jean Jennings
```

Frances commits her changes and pushes them to *her* repository on GitHub:

```shell
frances:~/plotting $ git commit -a -m "Adding Jean as a contributor"
```

```text

```

The situation is now as shown in (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-pull-request)a),
with Frances's changes on her desktop and in her GitHub repository
but not in either of Jean's repositories.
Since Jean has create a remote that points at Frances's GitHub repository,
though,
she can easily pull those changes to her desktop (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-pull-request)b):

```shell

Pulling from a repository owned by someone else
is no different than pulling from a repository we own.
In either case,
Git merges the changes and asks us to resolve any conflicts that arise.
The only significant difference is that,
as with `git push` and `git pull`,
we have to specify both a remote and a branch:
in this case,
`upstream` and `master`.

## What is a pull request and how do I create one? {#r-rse-git-advanced-pull-requests}

Jean can now get Frances's work,
but how can Frances get Jean's?
One way would be for Frances to create a remote that pointed at Jean's repository on GitHub
and then pull in Jean's changes periodically,
but that would lead to chaos,
since we could never be sure that everyone's work was in any one place at the same time.
Instead,
almost everyone uses [pull requests][pull-request] instead.

Pull requests aren't part of Git itself,
but a great way to collaborate with others using [forges][forge] like GitHub.
A pull request is essentially a note saying,
"Someone would like to merge branch A of repository B into branch X of repository Y".
The pull request does not contain the changes,
but instead points at two particular branches.
If either branch changes,
the difference displayed is always up to date (Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-how-pr-works)).

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-how-pr-works, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="How Pull Requests Work"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

A pull request can store more than just the source and destination branches:
it can also store comments people have made about the proposed merge.
GitHub and other [forges][forge] allow users to comment on the pull request as a whole,
or on particular lines,
and mark comments as out of date
if the author of the pull request updates the code that the comment is attached to
(Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-git-advanced-comment-out-of-date)).
It is common for complex changes to go through several rounds of review and revision
before being merged.

```{r r-rse-git-advanced-comment-out-of-date, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Comment Out of Date"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

To see this in action,
suppose that Jean wants to add her email address to `README.md` in the plotting project.
She creates a new branch and switches to it:

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git checkout -b adding-email
```

```text
Switched to a new branch 'adding-email'
```

then makes her change and commits it:

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ nano README.md
jj:~/plotting $ git commit -a -m "Adding my email address"
```

```text
[master b8938eb] Adding my email address
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git diff -r HEAD~1
```

```text
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

--- a/README.md

@@ -3,4 +3,4 @@
 Contributors:

+-   Jean Jennings <jj@eniac.org>
```

Her changes are in her desktop repository, and *only* in her desktop repository.
She cannot create a pull request until those changes are on GitHub,
so she pushes her new branch to her repository on GitHub:

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git push origin adding-email
```

```text

 * [new branch]      adding-email -> adding-email
```

When Jean goes to her GitHub repository in the browser,
GitHub notices that she has just pushed a new branch
and asks her if she wants to create a pull request:

```{r image-after-jean-pushes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="After Jean Pushes"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/after-jean-pushes.png")
```

When Jean clicks on the button,
GitHub displays a page showing the default source and destination of the pull request
and a pair of editable boxes for the pull request's title and a longer comment:

```{r image-pull-request-a, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Starting Pull Request"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pull-request-a.png")
```

If she scrolls down,
she can see a summary of the changes that will be in the pull request:

```{r image-pull-request-b, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Summary of Pull Request"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pull-request-b.png")
```

She fills in the top two boxes:

```{r image-fill-in-pull-request, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Filling In Pull Request"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/fill-in-pull-request.png")
```

and clicks on "Create Pull Request".
GitHub does that
and then displays a page showing the new pull request:

```{r image-new-pull-request, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="New Pull Request"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/new-pull-request.png")
```

Note that this pull request is displayed in Frances's repository rather than Jean's
since it is Frances's repository that will be affected if the pull request is merged.

Some time later,
Frances checks her repository and sees that there is a pull request:

```{r image-viewing-new-pull-request, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Viewing Pull Request"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/viewing-new-pull-request.png")
```

Clicking on the "Pull requests" tab brings up a list of PRs:

```{r image-pr-list, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Listing Pull Requests"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-list.png")
```

and clicking on the pull link itself displays more information about it:

```{r image-pr-details, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pull Request Details"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-details.png")
```

Since there are no conflicts,
GitHub will allow Frances to merge the PR immediately using the "Merge pull request" button.
She could also discard or reject it *without* merging using the "Close pull request" button.
Instead,
she clicks on the "Files changed" tab to see what Jean has changed:

```{r image-pr-changes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Files Changed"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-changes.png")
```

If she moves her mouse over particular lines,
a white-on-blue cross appears near the numbers to indicate that she can add comments:

```{r image-pr-comment-marker, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Comment Marker"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-comment-marker.png")
```

She clicks on the marker beside her own name and writes a comment:

```{r image-pr-writing-comment, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Writing Comment"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-writing-comment.png")
```

She only wants to make one comment rather than write a lengthier multi-comment review,
so she clicks on "Add single comment".
GitHub redisplays the page with her comment inserted inline:

```{r image-pr-with-comment, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pull Request With Comment"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-with-comment.png")
```

While all of this has been doing on,
GitHub has been emailing notifications to both Jean and Frances.
When Jean clicks on the link in hers,
it takes her to the PR and shows her Frances's comment.
She changes `README.md`,
commits,
and pushes,
but does *not* create a new pull request or do anything to the existing one.
As explained above,
a PR is a note asking that two branches be merged,
so if either end of the merge changes,
the PR updates automatically.

Sure enough,
when Frances looks at the PR again a few moments later she sees this:

```{r image-pr-with-fix, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Pull Request With Fix"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-with-fix.png")
```

Satisfied,
she goes back to the "Conversation" tab and clicks on "Merge".
The icon at the top of the PR's page changes text and color to show that the merge was successful:

```{r image-pr-successful-merge, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Successful Merge"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-git-advanced/pr-successful-merge.png")
```

To get those changes from GitHub to her desktop repository,
Frances uses `git pull`:

```shell
frances:~/plotting $ git pull origin master
```

```text

remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.

 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

To get the change she just made from her `adding-email` branch into her `master` branch,
Jean could use `git merge` on the command line.
It's a little clearer,
though,
if she also uses `git pull` from her `upstream` repository (i.e., Frances's repository)
so that she's sure to get any other changes that Frances may have merged:

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git checkout master
```

```text
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
```

```shell
jj:~/plotting $ git pull upstream master
```

```text

```

All four repositories are now synchronized.

This process may seem overly complicated when it is described step by step,
but it quickly becomes second nature.
Everyone involved in the project can work at their own pace,
picking up others' changes and submitting their own whenever they want.
More importantly,
everyone has a chance to review work before it lands in the main repository.
As we discuss in Section \@ref(r-rse-style-review),
doing reviews doesn't just prevent errors from creeping in:
it is also an effective way to spread understanding and skills.

## How can I label a particular version of my project? {#r-rse-git-advanced-tag}

A [tag][tag] is a permanent label on a particular state of the repository.
Tags are theoretically redundant,
since the [full identifier][full-identifier-git] identifies that state as well,
but full identifiers are hard to remember and type,
and their [shortened versions][short-identifier-git] aren't any more meaningful.

Projects therefore use annotated tags to mark every major event in the project's history.
These tags are called "annotated" because
they allow their creators to add explanatory messages
just like [commit messages][commit-message].
For example,
a research project could use `report-date-event` for tag names,
such as `jse-2018-06-23-response` or `pediatrics-2018-08-15-summary`.

If we want to tag the most recent commit in the current branch
(i.e., the `HEAD`),
all we have to do is tell Git what name to give the tag:

```shell
$ git tag -a -m "It is DONE" thesis-final
```

(Please don't ever actually tempt fate by calling something `-final`.)
The `-a` option tells Git that we want to annotate the tag,
while `-m` tells it that we're providing a message on the command line.
If we want to see what tags have already been created,
we can use `git tag` on its own.
We can also tag an old commit by providing the full identifier after the tag name:

```shell
$ git tag -a -m "I should have known better" thesis-revisions 8e966b5f0703d347e4f84817f12b48f456a58ae1
```

Most software projects use [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning] for software releases,
which produces three-part version numbers `major.minor.patch`:

-   Increment `major` every time there's an incompatible externally-visible change.
-   Increment `minor` when adding functionality without breaking any existing code.
-   Increment `patch` for bug fixes that don't add any new features ("now works as previously documented").

Simple projects should only tag the `master` branch
because every feature or bug fix is merged to `master` when it is finished.
Larger software projects may create a branch for each released version and do minor or patch updates on that branch,
but this is outside the scope of this lesson.
