# Git at the Command Line {#git-cmdline}

```{r git-cmdline-setup, include=FALSE}
source("_common.R")
```

The first two volumes in this series introduced version control with Git
using a graphical interface like [GitKraken][gitkraken] or [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide].
These interfaces are actually wrappers around Git's original command-line interface,
which allows us to access all of Git's features.
This lesson describes how the basic cycle of add, commit, push, and pull works at the command line.

## How can I set up Git for command-line use? {#git-cmdline-setup}

On a command line,
we write Git commands as <code>git <em>verb</em> <em>options</em></code>,
where the [subcommand][subcommand] <code><em>verb</em></code> tells Git what we want to do
and <code><em>options</em></code> provide any additional optional information that subcommand needs.
Using this syntax,
the first thing we need to do is configure Git:

```shell
$ git config --global user.name "Frances Bilas"
$ git config --global user.email "frances@eniac.org"
```

(Please use your own name and email address instead of the one shown.)
Here,
`config` is the verb
and the rest of the command are options.
We put the name in quotation marks because it contains a space;
we don't actually need to quote the email address,
but do so for consistency.
Since we are going to be using [GitHub][github],
the email address should be the same as the one we used when setting up our GitHub account.

These two commands only need to be run once:
the flag `--global` tells Git to use the settings for all of our projects on this computer.
We can re-run these commands any time if you want to change our details.
We can also check our settings:

```shell
$ git config --list
```

```text
user.name=Frances Bilas
user.email=frances@eniac.org
core.autocrlf=input
core.editor=nano
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.ignorecase=true
```

> we can get a list of the ones available using `--help`.
> This option will also give us more information about specific commands.

> ```shell
> $ git --help
> $ git config --help
> ```

## How can I create a new repository? {#git-cmdline-repos}

Once Git is configured, we can start using it.
This section will cover how to create a Git repository associated with a project folder.
As a running example,
we will watch as Frances and her colleague Jean Jennings write a history of the [ENIAC project][eniac].
First,
let's create a directory for our work beneath our home directory and go into it:

```shell
$ cd ~
$ mkdir eniac
$ cd eniac
```

We then tell Git to make this directory a [repository][repository],
i.e.,
a place where Git can store versions of our files:

```shell
$ git init .
```

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/frances/eniac/.git/
```

`ls` seems to show that the directory is still empty:

```shell
$ ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `eniac` called `.git`:

```shell
$ ls -a
```

```text
.	..	.git
```

Git stores information about the project in this special subdirectory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose that history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

## How can I save and track changes? {#git-cmdline-changes}

Now that we have a repository for our work,
we can add files to it and track their history.
Most of the commands we will use (such as `git add` and `git commit`) will sound familiar,
as the same terminology is used in graphical interfaces like [GitKraken][gitkraken] and [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide].

To start, let's make sure we're still in the right directory:

```shell
$ cd ~/eniac
```

Let's use our favorite text editor
to create a file called `names.txt` that contains
the names of the original six ENIAC programmers:

```text
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay Mcnulty
Betty Synder
```

(There are some typos and omissions here that we will fix later.)
If we check the status of our project,
Git tells us that we have a new file:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	names.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

"Untracked files" means there is a file in the directory whose history Git isn't tracking.
We can tell Git to start keeping track of of it using `git add`:

```shell
$ git add names.txt
```

and then check that it did what we wanted:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   names.txt
```

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `names.txt`,
but it hasn't actually recorded any changes yet.
To do taht,
we need to tell it to [commit][commit] our work:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Starting notes on ENIAC personnel"
```

```text
[master (root-commit) 8e966b5] Starting notes on ENIAC personnel
 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 names.txt
```

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit][commit] or a [revision][revision].
In this case,
its [short identifier][short-identifier-git] is `8e966b5`;
your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` option (short for <strong>m</strong>essage)
to record a short descriptive that will remind us later what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano`
(or whatever other editor is configured using `git config --global core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer [commit message][commit-message].
Once again,
we put the message in double quotes because it contains spaces.

If we run `git status` now,
Git tells us that everything is up to date:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can display the project's history using `git log`:

```shell
$ git log
```

```text
commit 8e966b5f0703d347e4f84817f12b48f456a58ae1
Author: Frances Bilas <frances@eniac.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 10 09:24:04 2019 -0400

    Starting notes on ENIAC personnel
```

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's [full identifier][full-identifier-git]
(which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by `git commit` earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

Now suppose Frances goes and corrects the two typos
("Mcnulty" should be "McNulty" and "Synder" should be "Snyder")
so that the file contains this:

```text
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay McNulty
Betty Snyder
```

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   names.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them
(which we do with `git commit`).

Let's do that now.
It is good practice to review our changes before saving them,
which we can do with `git diff`.
This command shows us the differences between the current state of our repository
and the most recently saved version:

```shell
$ git diff
```

```text
diff --git a/names.txt b/names.txt
index deca855..46a1948 100644
--- a/names.txt
+++ b/names.txt
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 Frances Bilas
 Jean Jennings
 Ruth Lichterman
-Kay Mcnulty
-Betty Synder
+Kay McNulty
+Betty Snyder
```

The output is cryptic (even by the standards of the Unix command line)
because it is actually a series of commands telling editors and other tools
how to turn the file we *had* into the file we *have*.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output
    in the format of the Unix `diff` command.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing:
    `deca855` and `46a1948` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed;
    the name appears twice in case we are renaming a file as well as modifying it.
4.  The remaining lines show us the changes and the lines on which they occur.
    A minus sign `-` in the first column indicates a line that is being removed,
    while a plus sign `+` shows a line that is being added.

After reviewing our change
we can commit it just as we did before:

```shell
$ git commit -m "Correcting typos in names"
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
	modified:   names.txt

no changes added to commit
```

Whoops:
we forgot to add the file to the set of things we want to commit.
Let's fix that:

```shell
$ git add names.txt
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   names.txt
```

```shell
$ git commit -m "Correcting typos in names"
```

```text
[master 61d3964] Correcting typos in names
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

If we are sure we want to commit all of our changes,
we can combine `git add` and `git commit` into a single command.
Let's add a missing name to the bottom of our file:

```text
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay McNulty
Betty Snyder
Marlyn Wescoff
```

and then save our work in one step by giving `git commit` the `-a` option:

```shell
$ git commit -a -m "Adding missing name"
```

```text
[master f865209] Adding missing name
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

## How can I synchronize with other repositories? {#git-cmdline-remotes}

Sooner or later our computer will experience a hardware failure,
be stolen,
or be thrown in the lake by someone who thinks we shouldn't spend the *entire* vacation working on our thesis.
Even before that happens
we will probably want to collaborate with others,
which we can do by linking our local repository to one stored on a hosting service such as [GitHub][github].

The first step in doing that is to create an account on GitHub if we don't already have one,
and then to create a new repository to synchronize with.
The remote repository doesn't have to have the same name as the local one,
but we will probably get confused if they are different,
so the repository we create on GitHub will also be called `eniac`.

The next step is to connect the two repositories.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a [remote][remote-repository] for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it
(Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-repo-link)).

```{r git-cmdline-repo-link, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Where to Find the Repository Link"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

We can click on "HTTPS" to change the URL from SSH to HTTPS
and then copy that URL.

> **HTTPS vs. SSH**
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.
> You may want to set up SSH access,
> which is a bit more secure,
> by following one of the tutorials from [GitHub][git-ssh-github],
> [Bitbucket][git-ssh-bitbucket],
> or [GitLab][git-ssh-gitlab]
> (the last of which includes a screencast).

Next,
let's go into the local `eniac` repository and run this command:

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/frances/eniac.git
```

Make sure to use the URL for your repository instead of the one shown:
the only difference should be that it includes your username instead of `frances`.

A Git remote is like a bookmark:
it gives a short name to a URL.
In this case,
the remote's name is `origin`;
we could use anything we want,
but `origin` is Git's default,
so we will stick with it.
We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`
(where the `-v` option is short for <strong>v</strong>erbose):

```shell
$ git remote -v
```

```text
origin	https://github.com/frances/eniac.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/frances/eniac.git (push)
```

Git displays two lines because it's actually possible to set up a remote
to download from one URL but upload to another.
Sensible people don't do this,
so we won't explore this possibility any further.

Once we have set up the remote,
we can [push][git-push] the work we have done so far to the repository on GitHub:

```shell
$ git push origin master
```

This may prompt us to enter our username and password;
once we do that,
we see a few lines of administrative information:


```text
Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 833 bytes | 277.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 9 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
To github.com:frances/eniac.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

If we view our GitHub repository in the browser,
we will now see that it includes `names.txt`
along with all of the commits we made to create it (Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-history)).

```{r git-cmdline-history, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Repository History"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

We can now [pull][git-pull] changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

```shell
$ git pull origin master
```

```text
From https://github.com/frances/eniac
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.

## How can I explore a project's history? {#git-cmdline-history}

We have now made three changes to our project.
Git lets us look at the previous versions of the project files
and restore specific files to earlier states if we want to.
To do this,
we need to use an identifier that indicates the versions we want.

There are two ways to do this,
which are similar in spirit to [absolute][absolute-path] and [relative][relative-path] paths.
The "absolute" version is the unique identifier that Git gives to each commit.
These identifiers are 40 characters long,
but in most situations Git will let us use just the first half dozen characters or so.
For example,
if we run `git log` right now,
it shows us something like this:

```text

```

If we add a title to the top of `names.txt` so that it contains:

```text
Personnel:
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay McNulty
Betty Snyder
Marlyn Wescoff
```

then `git diff` on its own will show the difference between the file as it is
and the most recent version:

```text

index 53b863e..fddc85e 100644

but `git diff -r 61d3964` shows the difference between the current state
and the file as it was after that commit:

```text

```

Note that you may need to use a different identifier than `61d3964`.
Note also that we have *not* committed this change:
we will look at ways of undoing it in the next section.

The "relative" version of history relies on a special identifier called `HEAD`,
which always refers to the most recent version in the repository.
`git diff -r HEAD` (where the option `-r` is short for <strong>r</strong>evision)
shows the same thing as `git diff`.
Instead of typing in a version identifier to back up one commit,
though,
we can simply use `HEAD~1` (where `~` is the tilde symbol).
This shorthand is read "HEAD minus one",
and gives us the difference to the *previous* saved version.
`git diff -r HEAD~2` goes back two revisions and so on.

We can also look at the differences between two saved versions
by separating their identifiers with two dots `..` like this:

```shell
$ git diff -r HEAD~1..HEAD~2
```

```text

we do not need the `-r` option in this case:

## How can I restore old versions of files? {#git-cmdline-restore}

We can see what we changed,
but how can we restore it?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to `names.txt`
before we add it or commit it.
`git status` tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been [staged][git-stage]:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   names.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were in the last saved revision using `git checkout`:

```shell
$ git checkout HEAD names.txt
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```shell
$ cat names.txt
```

```text
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay McNulty
Betty Snyder
Marlyn Wescoff
```

As its name suggests,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we told Git to recover the version of the file saved in `HEAD`,
i.e.,
in the most recent commit.
We can use a commit identifier to go back as far as we want:

```shell
$ git checkout 8e966b5 names.txt
$ cat names.txt
```

```text
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay Mcnulty
Betty Synder
```

Doing this does *not* change the history:
`git log` still shows our three commits.
Instead,
it replaces the content of the file with the old content:

```shell
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   names.txt
```

Notice that the changes have already been added to the staging area for new commits.
We can bring the file back in sync with the most recent commit using `git checkout`:

```shell
$ git checkout HEAD names.txt
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```shell
$ cat names.txt
```

```text
Frances Bilas
Jean Jennings
Ruth Lichterman
Kay McNulty
Betty Snyder
Marlyn Wescoff
```

Since we didn't commit the change in which we added the line `Personnel`,
that work is now lost:
Git can only go back and forth between committed versions of files.

## How can I tell Git to ignore some files? {#git-cmdline-ignore}

We have only modified one file in this tutorial,
but everything we have done works just as well with multiple files.
Sometimes,
though,
we don't want Git to track files' history.
For example,
we might want to track text files with names ending in `.txt`
but not data files with names ending in `.dat`.

To stop Git from telling us about these files every time we call `git status`,
we can create a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`.
This file can contain filenames like `thesis.pdf`
or [wildcard][wildcard] patterns like `*.dat`.
Each must be on a line of its own,
and Git will ignore anything that matches any of these lines.

> **Remember to Ignore**
>
> Don't forget to commit `.gitignore` to your repository
> so that Git knows to use it.

## Exercises {#git-cmdline-exercises}

### Places to create Git repositories {#git-cmdline-ex-places}

Along with information about the ENIAC project,
Frances would also like to keep some notes on the UNIVAC.
Despite her colleagues' concerns,
Frances creates a `univac` project inside her `eniac` project as follows:

```shell
$ cd ~/eniac     # go into eniac directory, which is already a Git repository
$ mkdir univac   # make a subdirectory eniac/univac
$ cd univac      # go into univac subdirectory
$ git init       # make univac a Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command that she runs inside the `univac` subdirectory
required for tracking files stored there?

### Committing changes {#git-cmdline-ex-commit}

Which command(s) below would save changes to `myfile.txt` to a local Git repository?

1. ```shell
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```

2. ```shell
   $ git init myfile.txt
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```

3. ```shell
   $ git add myfile.txt
   $ git commit -m "my recent changes"
   ```

4. ```shell
   $ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"
   ```

### Committing multiple files {#git-cmdline-ex-multiple}

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1.  Add some commas to `names.txt` to separate first and last names.

2.  Create a new file `old-computers.txt`
    and write a few lines about the first computer you remember seeing or using.

3.  Add changes from both files to the staging area
    and commit those changes.

### Write a biography {#git-cmdline-ex-bio}

-   Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
-   Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt` and commit your changes.
-   Modify one line and add a fourth line.
-   Display the differences between the file's original state and its updated state.

### Ignoring nested files {#git-cmdline-ex-ignore-nested}

Suppose our project has a directory `results` with two subdirectories called `data` and `plots`.
How would we ignore all of the files in `results/plots`
but not ignore files in `results/data`?

### Including specific files {#git-cmdline-ex-include}

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for `final.dat`?
(Hint: find out what the exclamation mark `!` means in a `.gitignore` file.)

### Exploring the GitHub interface {#git-cmdline-ex-github-interface}

Browse to your `eniac` repository on GitHub.
Under the `Code` tab,
find and click on the text that says "NN commits" (where "NN" is some number).
Hover over and click on the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?

### GitHub timestamps {#git-cmdline-ex-timestamp}

-   Create a remote repository on GitHub.
-   Push the contents of your local repository to the remote.
-   Make changes to your local repository and push these changes as well.
-   Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the timestamps of the files.

How does GitHub record times, and why?

### Push versus commit {#git-cmdline-ex-push-commit}

How is `git push` different from `git commit`?

### License and README files {#git-cmdline-ex-boilerplate}

When we initialized our GitHub repo,
we didn't add a `README.md` or license file.
If we had,
what would have happened when we tried to link our local and remote repositories?

### Recovering older versions of a file {#git-cmdline-ex-recover}

Jennifer made changes this morning to a shell script called `data_cruncher.sh`
that she has been working on for weeks.
Her changes broke the script,
and she has now spent an hour trying to get it back in working order.
Luckily,
she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git.
Which of the commands below can she use
torecover the last committed version of her script?

1.  `$ git checkout HEAD`
2.  `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.sh`
3.  `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.sh`
4.  `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.sh`
5.  Both 2 and 4

### Workflow and history {#git-cmdline-ex-history}

What is the output of the last command in the sequence below?

```
$ cd eniac
$ echo "ENIAC was the world's first computer." > history.txt
$ git add history.txt
$ echo "ENIAC was the world's first general-purpose electronic computer." > history.txt
$ git commit -m "Origins of ENIAC"
$ git checkout HEAD history.txt
$ cat history.txt

### Understanding `git diff` {#git-cmdline-ex-diff}

-   What will the command `git diff HEAD~9 names.txt` do if we run it?
-   What does it actually do?
-   What does `git diff HEAD names.txt` do?

### Getting rid of staged changes {#git-cmdline-ex-unstage}

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made,
but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
To find out:

-   Change `names.txt`.
-   `git add` that change.
-   Use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your change.

Does it work?

### Figuring out who did what {#git-cmdline-ex-blame}

Run the command `git blame names.txt`.

-   What does each line of the output show?
-   Why do some lines start with a circumflex `^`?
