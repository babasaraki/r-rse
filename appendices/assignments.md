# Course Assignments

This course is designed to have learners complete three project deliverables,
with individual milestones in each project.

## Package 

This will be a simpler package compared to the next one

- Package created alone as the first deliverable

- Recommended to be due after "Build Management" lesson REF
    
- Improve existing package to fit best practices (Pull Request is optional, dependent
on maintainer wishes).

- Package created as a team as the third deliverable (but indicate that this is
dependent on classes that allow group work, so instructor should use this if wanted)
    - Due after teamwork lesson (so they have learned the basic skills of package dev
    and now start from scratch with these skills to create a package)


Ideas to how project should be started:

- We give them several general problems to solve, with or without data that needs to be worked
    - Or existing solutions that could be improved on
- We get them to re-create an existing package that could use more work or development
(there are no end to these types of packages, especially the earlier ones)
    - Could get them to refactor code to be more readable
- We get them to choose an existing package to develop on their own and then
to contribute back (e.g. develop a website for the package and update the documentation)
- In all examples, include instructions for instructors on how to design their
own, more field-specific and class context-dependent problems.
    - Provide pretty concrete problems/examples, and then let individual
    instructors deviate to more student directed problems if they want. E.g.
    it's a lot easier for an instructor to evaluate an alternate project, if
    they already have an example to look at that they know will work out.
