# Folder and file structure (RStudio R Projects)

- File paths, very basics of the shell (in RStudio)
  - `cd`, `ls`, flags
- Working directory and how it is set with RStudio R Projects
- Making use of the fs package for filesystem management



## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

FIXME: using `usethis::create_package` in the next chapter?
- Is there anything we actually need to create here?
- Are final exercises entirely applied, or should they be conceptual too?

1. Create a new RStudio project for your project assignment,
and answer the following questions:
  - What is the absolute path to your project directory?
  - If you close RStudio, how can you ensure your working directory is your project directory when you next open the application?

2. Practice creating files with fs and comparing with `usethis` functions?
