# Setting up an R package

- Describing what a package is and when or why to make one
- Using devtools, usethis for development
- e.g. `use_devtools()` and `use_usethis()`.
- Developing functions
- Basic explanation of what a function is and its components
- Actual process of taking code and converting it into a function will
    be done in next chapter
- Making and using datasets
- Downloading zipf data at this point, using `usethis::use_data_raw()`, write the script to download the data and process into `data/` via `usethis::use_data()`.



## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

1. Use `create_package()` to create a package called FIXME.  

2. Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file to add:

    * yourself as the author, and
    * a one sentence description of the package.

3. Add data to the package

   The raw data and a script to clean the data are provided at: FIXME
   
   Following to steps in Section FIXME 
   to make the FIXME data available as part of the package.
 
You'll know you are finished if:

* Your package can be installed with `install()`. 
* In a fresh R session, 
    after running `library(FIXME)` you can access the data by name.
