# Continuous Integration {#r-rse-ci}

```{r r-rse-ci-setup, include=FALSE}
source("_common.R")
```

[Continuous integration][continuous-integration] (CI) a simple idea:
merge and test changes to a project automatically and frequently
so that developers get feedback about problems
while those changes are still fresh in their minds.
Automation tools like Make (Chapter \@ref(r-rse-automate)) can compile software,
run tests,
re-do analyses,
and re-create reports with a single command;
CI tools run those commands and give users feedback every time
something changes in the project's repository.
These tools can also be set up to run tests with several different configurations of the software
or on several different operating systems,
so that (for example) if a programmer makes a change on Windows
that would break something for Mac users or vice versa,
they find out before their friends' lives are disrupted.

This chapter introduces a CI tool called [Travis CI][travis-ci]
that integrates well with [GitHub][github].
If Travis CI has been set up,
then every time a change is committed to a GitHub repository,
Travis CI creates a fresh environment,
checks out a copy of the project,
and runs whatever commands the project's managers have set up.
If the project uses a language like C++ or Java,
those commands usually start by compiling the source code to create a runnable program
(Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-ci-conceptual)).
If we want to reassure ourselves that our software works,
we can create unit tests as described in Chapter \@ref(r-rse-correct)
and ask Travis CI to run them as well
so that (for example) we know whether the code on a branch is working
before we merge it into the master branch (Section \@ref(r-rse-git-advanced-merge)).
And if we want to do more,
we just have to write the commands.
For example,
we have Travis CI set up to re-create the PDF and HTML versions of this book
every time a pull request is merged.

## How do I set up continuous integration? {#r-rse-ci-basic}

We have to do five things to set up continuous integration:

1.  Create an account with [Travis CI][travis-ci].
1.  Link our Travis CI account to our GitHub account.
1.  Tell Travis CI to watch the repository that contains our project.
1.  Create a `.travis.yml` file in your repository
    to tell Travis CI what language we are working in
    and what we want to do.
1.  Commit that `.travis.yml` file to the repository.

> **There's More Than One Way to Do It**
>
> This process is for general Travis CI usage.
> If we are working with R projects or packages,
> we can simplify things considerably using `usethis::use_travis`
> (Section \@ref(r-rse-ci-setting-up-with-r)).

Creating an account with an online service is a familiar process for most of us,
but linking our Travis CI account to our GitHub account may be new.
When we do this,
we are not only telling Travis CI who we are on GitHub:
we are also telling GitHub that it's OK for Travis CI to get information about us
via GitHub's [API][api].
This permission is necessary—without it,
we would have to enter our password every time Travis CI wanted to run,
which would hardly count as "automated"—but
we should always check carefully when authorizing a service like this
to make sure we are comfortable with what it is planning to do.

### Watching a repository

We tell Travis CI about our repository through its website interface.
On the left,
besides the "My Repositories",
we can click the "+" to add a repository that is already on GitHub
(Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-ci-add-repo)).
After finding our repository in the list that pops up,
we flick the switch button so that it is green
(Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-ci-list-repos)).
If our repository doesn't show up,
we can re-synchronize the list using the green "Sync account" button on the left sidebar.
If it still doesn't appear,
the repository may belong to someone else or be private.


```{r r-rse-ci-add-repo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ci-add-repo"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-correct/travis-add-repo.png")
```

```{r r-rse-ci-list-repos, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="ci-list-repos"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-correct/travis-list-repos.png")
```

### Setting up a repo

TODO: Explain what the travis yml file does in R

Travis CI' summary report tells us whether the build passed,
which is shown in green Figure \@ref(fig:r-rse-ci-build-overview),
or whether it produced warnings or errors,
which are shown in red.


```{r r-rse-ci-build-overview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Travis Build Overview"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-correct/travis-build-pass.png")
```

The log below this overview contains a wealth of information
that can help us debug when the build fails.

## How can I display my project's status on GitHub? {#r-rse-ci-display-github}

TODO: Can remove, use_travis adds this automatically

Once we commit and push thsi change to GitHub,
our project will now show the badge for its Travis CI status Figure \@ref(fig:image-github-icon).

```{r r-rse-ci-github-icon, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Travis CI Build Badge"}
#knitr::include_graphics("figures/rse-ci/github-icon.png")
```

> **How Do Badges Work?**
>
> Badges are much simpler than they first appear.
> When someone visits our project,
> GitHub sends them the HTML of the project's home page.
> That page includes a link to an image on Travis CI's site,
> so our browser sends a request to Travis CI.
> The URL tells Travis CI's web server what project we're interested in;
> it then sends back a different image
> depending on the most recently recorded build status for that project.

## How can I set up Travis CI for an R project? {#r-rse-ci-setting-up-with-r}

The simplest way to set up and use Travis CI with R is to call:

```r
usethis::use_travis()
```

This command:

-   Creates a `.travis.yml` configuration file with typical settings for an R package.
-   Adds a Travis CI build badge to the project's `README.md`.
-   Opens the Travis CI page for the package so that we can activate Travis CI for the repository.
    (This assumes the package is already on GitHub and that we have a Travis CI account.)

FIXME: add example here of generated YAML file

The [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/ci.html) documentation has more details,
but it really is this simple.

## How can I use Travis CI to test my project? {#r-rse-ci-testing}

The main reason to set up CI is to test the project every time a change is made.
We still have to write unit tests (Chapter \@ref(r-rse-correct)),
but CI makes those tests much more valuable.

For R packages,
running tests is built into the way R builds in Travis CI, 
so you as long as you have a `tests/` directory,
the tests will run.

FIXME: Include example here of what failing tests in R look like in Travis CI.


With this in place,
the Travis CI log located right below the build overview
will contain all of the information that our testing command produces when tests fail.

We can also have Travis CI report the [code coverage][code-coverage] of our tests (Section \@ref(r-rse-correct-coverage)).
This command will set everything up for us:

```r
usethis::use_coverage()
```

FIXME: explain what this does to the YAML file.

## How can I use CI for other purposes? {#r-rse-ci-deploying}

Continuous integration was invented for testing,
but it can be used to automate almost anything.
For example,
if we want to create a website for an R package,
we can run:

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown()
usethis::use_pkgdown_travis()
```

to add lines like this to our `.travis.yml` file:

```yaml
language: R
sudo: false
cache: packages

before_cache: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_cran("pkgdown")'
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: Rscript -e 'pkgdown::deploy_site_github()'
  skip_cleanup: true
```

The `deploy` section tells Travis CI to put the generated website files online
using [GitHub Pages][github-pages].

FIXME: this section needs more detail.
As it is, readers will know something is possible
but not how it works or how to debug it when things go wrong.
At the least,
please explain what keys like `before_cache` are about
and provide a diagram showing what files are produced and copied where.

## Summary {#r-rse-ci-summary}

FIXME: create concept map for continuous integration.

## Exercises {#r-rse-ci-exercises}

FIXME: Get feedback on this and fill it out more later.

1. Setup Travis CI for the package you've been working on (for the course).
2. Get Travis CI to run unit tests of your package (not applicable for R packages).
3. Write a new unit test in your package that you *know* will fail. Push the changes
up to GitHub.
4. Go through the Travis CI log and see what the log says about the failure and
how to fix it. Since you made it purposefully fail, you will already know how to
fix it, but the point is to get comfortable looking through Travis CI' logs.
5. Correct the test, push to GitHub, and get Travis CI to build your package
successfully.
