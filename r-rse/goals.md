# RSE for R Goals and Narrative

The intermediate course starts with a few (simple)
pre-prepared scripts/programs for processing/analysing data.
(Perhaps the scripts written in the novice course?)
It works through the process of combining those scripts into a workflow for personal use,
before testing, organising, packaging and publishing the workflow
(or key programs within it) for wider use.

To be more specific, the course is structured as follows:

1. Learn some fundamentals: unix shell, version control
2. Combine the scripts into a workflow: configuring software, automating analyses
3. Test the workflow: testing, continuous integration
4. Get properly organised: project structure, project management
5. Release the software to the wider world: packaging, publishing

There is a long list of topics that we haven't included at the bottom of the page.
We could consider including some of them as bonus/elective lessons.

It is assumed that students have completed the novice course.
